# Echo Server Spec

This is an overview spec document which details the endpoint and what they expect to receive and in turn what responses
you can expect.

## Security

The details of Echo Server's Security are in [auth.md](./auth.md)

## Responses

These are the default responses and are only different if otherwise specified.

### Successful Response

```
{
    "status": "OK"
}
```

### Unsuccessful Response

```
{
    "status": "FAILED",
    "errors": [
        { "name": "", description": "" }
    ]
    "fields": [
        { "field": "type", "description": "", "location": "" }
    ]
}
```

This is sent whenever echo server encounters an error. 
The `fields` property will only be available if it is a user provided field that caused the error. 
The `errors` property will only be available when we can provide more generic errors e.g. Postgres error.

> **Note** `location` should be treated as an enum (`body`, `query`, `header`, `path`) where `body` is the
> default unless otherwise specified.

## Requests

### Health

```
GET <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/health
```

#### Example Response

```
OK, echo-server v0.1.0
```

### Register Client

```
POST <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients
{
    "client_id": <CLIENT_ID>,
    "type": <TYPE>,
    "token": <DEVICE_TOKEN>
}
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: The Client's ID from the Relay pairing.
- `TYPE`: The push service to use e.g. APNS, FCM. This will be validated against the supported types on the Echo
  Server's side.
- `DEVICE_TOKEN`: The device's token for the push service e.g. FCM, APNS.

### Unregister Client

```
DELETE <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients/<CLIENT_ID>
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: The Client's ID from the Relay pairing.

### Send Notification

```
POST <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients/<CLIENT_ID>
{
    "id": "0000-0000-0000-0000"
    "payload": {
      "topic": "<topic>",
      "flags": <flags>,
      "blob": "<blob>"
    }
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: This is used to map to the device token
- `id`: This is generated by the Relay to prevent duplicate notifications
- `payload`: A string with 3 values encoded and split with a `:` as a delimiter.
  - `topic`: This is used by the SDKs to decrypt encrypted payloads on the client side
  - `flags`: an integer value that uses bitmasks to encode information about the payload for the SDKs, the flags are below
    ```
    Encrypted  = 1 << 0
    Sign       = 1 << 1
    Auth       = 1 << 2
    Chat       = 1 << 3
    Push       = 1 << 4
    ```
  - `blob`: If the payload is encrypted this is just the encrypted blob, when this is cleartext it should be base64 encoded. The blob should follow the format from of the [Push Message](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/push/data-structures#push-message)
