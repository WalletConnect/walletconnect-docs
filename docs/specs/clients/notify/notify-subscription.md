# Notify Subscription

A Notify subscription is an agreement between a dapp and a wallet to receive future notifications.

A Wallet user will be able to authorize a dapp by sending an authenticated payload with a corresponding identity key and dapp URL as described by [Notify authentication](./notify-authentication.md)

There are however two flows for creating a notify subscription:

1. a subscription is subscribed by the wallet and sent to the dapp (Notify Subscribe)
2. a subscription is proposed by the dapp and subscribed by the wallet (Notify Proposal)
