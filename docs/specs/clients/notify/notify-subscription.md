# Notify Subscription

A Notify subscription is an agreement between a dapp and a wallet to receive future notifications.

A Wallet user will be able to authorize a dapp by sending an authenticated payload with a corresponding identity key and dapp URL as described by [Notify authentication](./notify-authentication.md)

In order to create subscription a wallet is subscribed by the wallet and sent to the dapp using the Subscribe protocol which is described below.

## User Flow

The Notify subscribe flow will require a dapp to host a static json file which will contain a DID document compliant with `did:web` method as specified [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). In this DID document we will specify a X25519 public key that will be used by the Notify API protocol to derive a symmetric key for the Notify topic.

On the Wallet side we will be able to fetch a list of dapps that expose public keys for Notify subscribe from a registry as for example our WalletConnect Cloud Explorer. These public keys are generated on the Notify server which will be able to listen for new subscriptions sent by the wallet to the subscribe topic which is the sha256 hash of the public key exposed.

Once the wallet user has selected the dapp which they intend to subscribe to, the wallet will be able to subscribe remotely without visiting the dapp.

## Subscribe Protocol

### Pre-requisites

The Notify subscribe flow will require a dapp to host a static json file which will contain a DID document compliant with `did:web` method as specified [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). In this DID document we will specify a X25519 public key that will be used by the Notify API protocol to derive a symmetric key for the Notify topic.

### Protocol

Subscribe protocol will be established as follows:

1. Wallet fetches public key X from the did:web document
2. Subscribe topic is derived from the sha256 hash of public key X
3. Wallet generates key pair Y
4. Wallet derives symmetric key S with keys X and Y
5. Wallet sends notify subscribe request (type 1 envelope) on subscribe topic with subscriptionAuth
6. Response topic is derived from the sha256 hash of symmetric key S
7. Wallet subscribes to response topic
8. Notify Server receives notify subscribe request on subscribe topic
9. Notify Server derives symmetric key and decrypts subscriptionAuth
10. Notify Server triggers webhook to notify Dapp of new registered address
11. Notify Server generates key pair Z
12. Notify Server derives symmetric key P with keys Y and Z
13. Notify Server responds to notify subscribe request on response topic
14. Wallet receives notify subscribe response on the response topic
15. Wallet derives symmetric key P
16. Notify topic is derived from the sha256 hash of the symmetric key P
17. Wallet subscribes to notify topic for future notify messages
