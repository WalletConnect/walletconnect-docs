# Usage of Sync API

In order to provide state synchronization between a user's devices we must add [Sync API](../core/sync/readme.md) support. As per Sync API requirements, the user [must sign an additional message](../core/sync/sync-protocol.md#generating-a-message-to-sign) to enable state synchronization.

## Stores

State synchronization is achieved by sharing the same key value stores among every client that the user
registered in Notify API. For Notify API there are the following stores:

### Notify Subscription Store

#### Store Name

`com.walletconnect.notify.notifySubscription`

#### Store Key

Key of [Notify Subscription Store](#notify-subscription-store) must be equal to `topic` from
[`NotifySubscription`](#notifysubscription) data structure.

#### NotifySubscription

```typescript
interface NotifySubscription {
  topic: string
  account: string
  relay: RelayerTypes.ProtocolOptions
  metadata: Metadata
  scope: ScopeMap
  expiry: number
  symKey: string
}
```

### Notify Subscription Protocol in multiclient environment

#### Definitions

- W1 - clients that have access to W (Wallet) blockchain account keys.
- Wx - peer clients that have access to W (Wallet) blockchain account keys.

#### Pre-requisities

The Notify subscribe flow will require a dapp to host a static json file which will contain a DID document compliant with `did:web` method as specified [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). In this DID document we will specify a X25519 public key that will be used by the Notify API protocol to derive a symmetric key for the Notify topic.

#### Protocol

Subscribe protocol will be established as follows:

1. W1 fetches public key X from the did:web document
2. Subscribe topic is derived from the sha256 hash of public key X
3. W1 generates key pair Y
4. W1 derives symmetric key S with keys X and Y
5. W1 sends notify subscribe request (type 1 envelope) on subscribe topic with subscriptionAuth
6. Response topic is derived from the sha256 hash of symmetric key S
7. W1 subscribes to response topic
8. Cast Server receives notify subscribe request on subscribe topic
9. Cast Server derives symmetric key S and decrypts subscriptionAuth
10. Cast Server triggers webhook to notify Dapp of new registered address
11. Cast Server generates key pair Z
12. Cast Server derives symmetric key P with keys Y and Z
13. Cast Server responds to notify subscribe request on response topic
14. W1 receives notify subscribe response on the response topic
15. W1 derives symmetric key P
16. Notify topic is derived from the sha256 hash of the symmetric key P
17. W1 subscribes to notify topic for future notify messages
18. W1 syncs the notify subscription with Wx
19. Wx stores the notify subscription
20. Wx subscribe to notify topic coming from the sync request.
