# Push Subscription

A Push subscription is an agreement between a dapp and a wallet to receive future push notifications.

A Wallet user will be able to authorize a dapp by sending an authenticated payload with a corresponding identity key and dapp url as described by [Push authentication](./push-authentication.md)

There are however two flows for creating a push subscription:

1. a subscription is subscribed by the wallet and sent to the dapp (Push Subscribe)
2. a subscription is proposed by the dapp and subscribed by the wallet (Push Proposal)

There is also a deprecated flow for creating a push subscription:

- a subscription is requested by the dapp and approved by the wallet (Push Request)
