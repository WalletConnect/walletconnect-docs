# Push Proposal

## User Flow

User visits application that connected with their wallet

App can prompt a push proposal after connecting or it can provide a "bell" button for the user to trigger the push proposal

User can approve or reject the push proposal from their wallet.

In future events, the app can trigger notifications after subscription has been approved.

## Proposal Protocol

### Pre-requisites

Wallet and Dapp are required to establish pairing topic before proceeding to Push protocol execution.

Additionally Wallet must meet the pre-requisites for [Push Subscribe](./push-subscribe.md) to complete this flow.

### Protocol

Proposal protocol will be established as follows:

1. Dapp generates keypair X
2. Dapp sends push proposal on pairing topic with public key X, relay, metadata and scope
3. Wallet receives push proposal with public key X on pairing topic
4. Wallet generates key pair Y
5. Wallet derives symmetric key with keys X and Y
6. Push topic is derived from sha256 hash of symmetric key 
7. Wallet sends push subscribe request to Push Server with subscriptionAuth
8. Wallet generates key pair Z
9. Response topic is derived from hash of public key X
10. Wallet responds with type 1 envelope on response topic to Dapp with subscriptionAuth and subscription symmetric key
11. Dapp receives the response and derives a subscription topic from sha256 hash of subscription symmetric key
12. Dapp subscribes for subscription topic to receive subscription updates published by the wallet
