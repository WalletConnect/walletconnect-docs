# Sync API

## Description

Sync API allows a wallet user to sync private data between multiple clients using a single signature from an account. It works similarly to [Storage API](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/storage/storage-api) but it can be accessible through multiple clients using a blockchain account signature.
