# Relay Client Auth

## Motivation

WalletConnect supports e2e encrypted messaging between multiple clients.
Should a recipient be offline, WalletConnect stores the encrypted messages in the recipient's mailbox until they reconnect.
The address of the mailbox is a unique sticky _client_id_ that clients present when they connect to WalletConnect.

This document discusses the creation and usage of the _client_id_ for authentication

## Overview

WalletConnect expects an `Authorization: Bearer <signed jwt>` header when establishing the Websocket connection. Where websocket headers are not supported i.e. browsers, use url query param `?auth=<signed jwt>`. Server should support both of these mechanisms.

The `client_id` is a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) of the public key for the key pair generated by the client when instantiating the SDK and persisted for the entire lifecycle.

Clients will generate a unique id per app initialization which will be used as a subject when signing a JWT with the `client_id` as the issuer and is persisted through duration of the app lifecycle.

## Specification

Here we describe how a client can generate a Ed25519 key pair to authenticate itself using the public key as it's client id

Additionally we describe how we can construct and sign a JWT using a client-side generated unique id as subject

Finally we describe how the public key is encoded as `did:key` identifier which is used as client id.

Client authentication is described with a did-jwt using the following claims:

`iat` - timestamp when jwt was issued

`exp` - timestamp when jwt must expire

`iss` - did:key of client id key. 

`aud` - relay server url

`sub` - random session identifier

`act` - description of action intent. Must be equal to "client_auth"

### Relay Session

A Relay session is defined by the following lifecycle conditions:

* Session initializes when the app loads for the first time
* Session terminates when the app is closed or terminated
* Session is persisted when switching between foreground and background
* Session is unique per each tab instance (specific for web browsers)

A Relay session identifier should be:

* Persisted through the whole session lifecycle
* Re-used whenever the websocket reconnects
* Formatted as 32 byte hex string
