:::

The Web3Inbox SDK combines functionality of
[Notify](../../clients/notify/README.md) and [Chat](../../clients/chat/README.md)
into one offering by giving access to the [Web3Inbox](https://web3inbox.com)
inner state and user interface.

This spec aims to model the inner "W3I proxy" state manager in Web3Inbox.com,
as well the native SDKs that will wrap it for native iOS or android experiences.
