# Relay User Agent

## Motivation

User Agent is an optional url parameter that provides context over the client's platform that is being run to enable Relay to identify issues regarding specific devices and/or operatign systems.

## Overview

Clients CAN include user agent under a url params or http headers when interfacing with Relay server.

Clients MUST derive information used in user agent parameters from native APIs available to the client's platform.

Clients MUST format each platform's parameters to comply with the specification schema.

## Specification

The schema for the client's User Agent will include the following:

- Protocol Version (protocol) - defines WalletConnect protocol version (eg. "wc-relay-2.0")
- SDK Version (sdk) - defines which SDK is being used (eg. "swift-2.0-rc.0" or "js-2.0-rc.0" or "kotlin-2.0-rc.0")
- Operating System (os) - defines which operating system is being used (eg "macos-12.4")

Additionaly the following optional params can be included if available:

- App identifier (id) - defines which application is being used (eg "browser-app.uniswap.org" or "android-com.walletconnect.example")

### Schema

    user-agent        = protocol + "/" sdk + "/" + os [ + "/" + id ]
    protocol          = "wc" + protocol-version
    protocol-version  = 1*DIGIT
    sdk               = sdk-prefix + sdk-version
    sdk-prefix        = ("js"|"swift"|"kotlin"|"csharp")
    sdk-version       = STRING
    os                = STRING
    id                = id-prefix + id-host
    id-prefix         = ("browser","react-native","nodejs","android","ios")
    id-host           = STRING
