# Installation

Install WalletKit package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/web3wallet @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills and the instance of ethers.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-community/netinfo react-native-get-random-values fast-text-encoding @ethersproject/shims ethers@5.7.2 @json-rpc-tools/utils
```
