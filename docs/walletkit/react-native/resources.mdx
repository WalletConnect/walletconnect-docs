# Resources

Valuable assets for developers and users interested in integrating Web3Wallet into their applications.

- [Awesome WalletConnect](https://github.com/WalletConnect/awesome-walletconnect) - Community-curated collection of WalletConnect-enabled wallets, libraries, and tools.
- [AppKit Laboratory](https://lab.web3modal.com) - A place to test your wallet integrations against various setups of AppKit.
- [WalletKit GitHub](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/tree/v2.0/packages/web3wallet) - WalletKit GitHub repository.

### Wallet Resources

[WalletKit](https://medium.com/walletconnect/simplifying-integration-for-wallet-developers-with-the-new-web3wallet-sdk-8706b69e149c) simplifies the integration process for wallet developers by combining our Sign and Auth APIs. Please note that only V2 [WCURIs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/pairing-uri) will work with this SDK, as V1 is being deprecated by June 28th, 2023.

#### Expo

Experimental: For Expo, we have an unofficial npx starter command. `newWallet` represents the name of your project.

```bash
npx create-wc-wallet-expo@latest newWallet
```

This downloads an Expo template with WalletKit installed. More information available in this [tutorial](https://medium.com/walletconnect/how-to-build-a-wallet-in-react-native-with-the-web3wallet-sdk-b6f57bf02f9a)
