# Link Mode

WalletKit link mode is a low latency mechanism for transporting One-Click Auth requests and session requests over universal links, reducing the need for a WebSocket connection with the Relay. This significantly enhances the user experience when connecting native dApps to native wallets by reducing the latency associated with networking connections, especially when the user has an unstable internet connection.

To support link mode add universal link for your wallet in Cloud project configuration dashboard, configure your AppMetaData `appLink` with a valid universal link and set the `linkMode` property to `true`:

```kotlin
 val appMetaData = Core.Model.AppMetaData(
    ...
    appLink = "https://example.com/example_wallet",
    linkMode = true
)

CoreClient.initialize(
   metaData: appMetaData,
    ...
)

Web3Wallet.initialize(Wallet.Params.Init(core = CoreClient))
```

Once link mode and app link are properly configured and the user interacts with a link mode supporting dApp, your wallet will receive requests over app links. You must pass these requests to WalletKit so it can process them:

```kotlin
val url = intent.dataString
Web3Wallet.dispatchEnvelope(url) { error ->
    //handle error
}
```

Ensure to handle incoming app links in your Activity onCreate method and in onNewIntent callback.

Ensure that your App Link is properly configured in your app's Manifest file with the `autoVerify` set to `true`:

```
<intent-filter android:autoVerify="true">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />

    <data
        android:host="your_host"
        android:scheme="https">
</intent-filter>
```
