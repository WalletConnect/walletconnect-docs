### How to test

Before submitting your project to the Cloud Explorer you can test mobile linking in our sample Dapp:

1. On your mobile device, visit the appropriate link:
- For EVM: https://lab.web3modal.com/library/wagmi/
- For Solana: https://lab.web3modal.com/library/solana/

2. Click the "Custom Wallet" button and fill in the form with your wallet information. The website will reload and your wallet will be stored locally.
3. Click the "Connect Wallet" button and choose you mobile wallet. It _should_ automatically open and redirect to your wallet.
