# React Native SDK

For React Native wallets, there's an state-managed SDK built on top of Notify Client, called Web3Inbox Client.

This is the same SDK used by web frontends to build their notification UI.

To get started explore the [Usage Section](../../web3inbox/frontend-integration/usage) in the sidebar.
