# Introduction

:::caution
Web3Inbox is in beta.

For those integrating notifications related to wallet pairing and sign requests, please check [here](../push-notifications.mdx).

The WalletConnect Notify API is designed to enhance the interaction between wallet users and dapps by offering a robust notification system. This API empowers wallet developers to implement a dynamic notification experience directly within their wallets. It provides the functionality for users to opt-in to notifications, ensuring they stay informed about critical events and interactions.

The Notify API is versatile, with support for both iOS and Android platforms, making it an ideal choice for cross-platform wallet applications.

Coupled with the [Web3Inbox SDK](../../web3inbox/about.mdx), the Notify API forms part of a comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless integration of web3 communication and messaging features into dapps. This ensures a more connected and interactive experience for users in the decentralized ecosystem.

## Features

Some of the key features of the Notify API include:

- **Push Notifications for Desktop and Native Platforms**: This feature enables dapps to directly send vital notifications to user wallets, ensuring timely and relevant communication.
- **Robust Spam Protection**: Users have complete authority over which dapps can send them notifications, effectively eliminating any unsolicited messages from unknown sources. Furthermore, users can fine-tune their preferences to only receive notifications types they are interested in, like new features or some important events occurence.
- **Chain Agnostic Architecture**: The Notify API is built to be compatible with any blockchain, allowing seamless multi-chain support without the need for writing additional integration code. **As of November 2023, the Notify Server and Clients are equipped to support EVM chains. Plans to extend support to non-EVM chains are in progress and are a significant part of our upcoming development roadmap.**
