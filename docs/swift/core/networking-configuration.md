# Networking Configuration

The networking client provides a transport layer for Sign, Auth, and Chat SDKs. You can configure it once, and every SDK will transport protocol messages via the same instance of a networking client with only one opened WebSocket connection.

### Setup Networking Client

Before using Sign or Auth SDK, it is necessary to configure a shared Networking Client instance. Set a project ID generated when starting a project on WalletConnect Cloud and SocketFactory instance.

WalletConnect Swift SDK does not depend on any websocket library. SocketFactory parameter allows you to pass your own implementation of websocket connection.

Here's an example of WebSocketFactory implementation using Starscream v3

```swift
import Starscream

extension WebSocket: WebSocketConnecting { }

struct SocketFactory: WebSocketFactory {
    func create(with url: URL) -> WebSocketConnecting {
        return WebSocket(url: url)
    }
}
```

### Networking client configuration 

```swift
Networking.configure(projectId: <String>, socketFactory: SocketFactory())
```

### Web Socket Connection

By default web socket connection is handled internally by the SDK. That means that Web socket will be safely disconnected when apps go to background and it will connect back when app reaches foreground. But if it is not expected for your app and you want to handle socket connection manually you can do it as follows:

1. set socketConnectionType for manual  
```swift
Networking.configure(projectId: <String>, socketFactory: SocketFactory(), socketConnectionType: .manual)
```  
2. control socket connection:  
```swift
try Networking.instance.connect()
```
```swift
try Networking.instance.disconnect()
```
