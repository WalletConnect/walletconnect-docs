# Wallet Usage

### Relay client

Make sure what you properly configure Relay Client first [Relay Configuration](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-docs/blob/main/docs/swift/relay/relay-setup.md)

### Instantiate a client

Create an AppMetadata object. It will describe your application and define its appearance in a web browser.
Then configure `Auth` instance with a metadata object you have instantiated and an Account object.

```swift
let metadata = AppMetadata(name: <String>,
                           description: <String>,
                           url: <String>,
                           icons: <[String]>)

Auth.configure(metadata: metadata, account: Account("eip155:56:0xe5EeF1368781911d265fDB6946613dA61915a501")!)
```

### Subscribe for Auth publishers
When your `Auth` instance receives requests or responses from a peer client it will publish related event. So you should set subscription to handle them.

```swift
Auth.instance.authRequestPublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [unowned self] _ in
        //handle event
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```
Following publishers are available to subscribe:

```swift
public var authRequestPublisher: AnyPublisher<AuthRequest, Never> {
public var authResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<(id: RPCID, result: Result<Cacao, AuthError>), Never> {
public let socketConnectionStatusPublisher: AnyPublisher<SocketConnectionStatus, Never>

```

### Connect Clients

Your Wallet should allow users to scan a QR code generated by dapps and handle universal linking. You are responsible for implementing it on your own.
Once you derive a URI from the QR code call `pair` method:

```swift
try await Auth.instance.pair(uri: uri)
```

### Handle requests from a dapp

After pairing with dapp, your wallet will be subscribing for authentication requests. Requests will be published by `authRequestPublisher`. When a wallet receives a request, you want to present it to the user and request a signature. After user signs authentication message wallet should respond to a dapp.

```swift
let signer = MessageSigner()
let signature = try signer.sign(message: request.message, privateKey: privateKey)
try await Auth.instance.respond(requestId: request.id, signature: signature)
```

Nn case user rejects an authentication request, call:
```swift
try await Auth.instance.reject(requestId: request.id)
```

### Get pending requests

if you've missed some requests you can querry them with
```swift 
Auth.instance.getPendingRequests()
```
