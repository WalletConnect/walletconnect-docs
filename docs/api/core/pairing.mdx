# Pairing API

The Pairing API is a lightweight API for establishing an encrypted, protocol-agnostic communication layer between peers.
Its purpose is to provide a secure channel for proposing protocols or sending requests between dapp and wallet.

<PlatformTabItem value="web">

WalletConnect currently offers Sign and Auth SDKs.
To allow a reusable communication channel between peers,
the Pairing API exposes a standard interface and allows for sending and receiving multi-protocol requests over a single pairing.

Each SDK uses the same implementation of `core/pairing` (via `@walletconnect/core`) to manage pairings.
To run multiple SDKs side-by-side (e.g. Sign and Auth), please refer to the [Sharing a Core instance] guide.

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

#### Add SDK for your project.

You can add a WalletConnect Core SDKs to your project with Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open XCode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub URL: https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2
4. Tap Add Package
5. Select WalletConnectPairing check mark

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

Kotlin implementation of Android CoreClient for all WalletConnect SDKs. This SDK is developed in Kotlin and usable in both Java and Kotlin files.

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.walletconnect/android-core)

#### Requirements

- Android min SDK 23
- Java 11

#### Installation

root/build.gradle.kts:

```gradle
allprojects {
 repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

app/build.gradle

```gradle
implementation("com.walletconnect:android-core:release_version")
```

#### Project set up

To use initialize RelayClient properly you will need a projectId. Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app, register your project and get projectId.

#### CoreClient initialization

Before using any of the WalletConnect Kotlin SDKs, it is necessary to initialize the CoreClient. The initialization of CoreClient must always happen in the Android Application class. Provide the projectId generated in the WalletConnect Cloud, the WebSocket URL, choose the connection type, and pass the application class. You can also pass your own Relay instance using the `RelayConnectionInterface`.

```kotlin
val projectId = "" //Get Project ID at https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
val relayUrl = "relay.walletconnect.com"
val serverUrl = "wss://$relayUrl?projectId=${projectId}"
val connectionType = ConnectionType.AUTOMATIC or ConnectionType.MANUAL
val application = //Android Application level class
[Optional] val optionalRelay: RelayConnectionInterface? = /*implement interface*/

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, relay = optionalRelay)
```

#### Using your own Relay instance

The CoreClient offers the ability to use a custom Relay client. Just creating an instance of `RelayConnectionInterface` and passing it to `CoreClient.initialize`.

```kotlin
...
val optionalRelay: RelayConnectionInterface = /*implement interface*/

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, relay = optionalRelay)
```

Install the `WalletConnect.Core` nuget package, which implements the Pairing API

```shell
dotnet add package WalletConnect.Core
```

Once the `WalletConnect.Core` library is installed, create a Metadata object. It will describe your application and define its appearance in a web browser. Then configure the Pair instance with a metadata object you have instantiated.

```csharp
var metadata = new Metadata()
{
    Name = "my-app",
    Description = "My app description",
    Icons = new[] { "https://walletconnect.com/meta/favicon.ico" },
    Url = "https://walletconnect.com",
}

var options = new CoreOptions()
{
    ProjectId = "...",
    Name = "my-app",
}

var core = new WalletConnectCore(options);
core.Pairing.Configure(metadata);
```

:::tip

Since `WalletConnectUnity` is a wrapper around `WalletConnectSharp`, usage of the pairing API is identical to `C#`. Please refer to C# documentation on how to use Pairing inside `WalletConnectUnity`.

#### Package Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="openupm-cli" label="OpenUPM CLI">

To install packages via OpenUPM, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [openupm-cli](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html#installing-openupm-cli) installed. Once you have them installed, you can run the following commands:

```bash
openupm add com.walletconnect.core
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pm-openupm" label="Package Manager with OpenUPM">

1. Open `Advanced Project Settings` from the gear ⚙ menu located at the top right of the Package Manager’s toolbar
2. Add a new scoped registry with the following details:
   - Name: `OpenUPM`
   - URL: `https://package.openupm.com`
   - Scope(s): `com.walletconnect`
3. Press plus ➕ and then `Save` buttons
4. In the Package Manager windows open the add ➕ menu from the toolbar
5. Select `Add package by name...`
6. Enter the package name:
   - `com.walletconnect.core`
7. Press `Add` button

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pm-git-utl" label="Package Manager with Git URL">

1. Open the add ➕ menu in the Package Manager’s toolbar
2. Select `Add package from git URL...`
3. Enter the package URL:

**WalletConnectUnity Core**

```
https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectUnity.git?path=Packages/com.walletconnect.core
```

4. Press `Add` button

It's possible to lock the version of the package by adding `#{version}` at the end of the git URL, where `#{version}` is the git tag of the version you want to use.
For example, to install version `1.0.1` of WalletConnectUnity Modal, use the following URL:

```
https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectUnity.git?path=Packages/com.walletconnect.core#core/1.0.1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### WebGL

Due to WebGL's single-threaded nature, certain asynchronous operations like `Task.Run`, `Task.ContinueWith`, `Task.Delay`, and `ConfigureAwait(false)` are not natively supported.

To enable these operations in WebGL builds, an additional third-party package, [WebGLThreadingPatcher](https://github.com/VolodymyrBS/WebGLThreadingPatcher), is required. This package modifies the Unity WebGL build to delegate work to the `SynchronizationContext`, allowing these operations to be executed on the same thread without blocking the main application. Please note that all tasks are still executed on a single thread, and any blocking calls will freeze the entire application.

The [WebGLThreadingPatcher](https://github.com/VolodymyrBS/WebGLThreadingPatcher) package can be added via git URL:

```
https://github.com/VolodymyrBS/WebGLThreadingPatcher.git
```

#### Initialization

1. Fill in the Project ID and Metadata fields in the `Assets/WalletConnectUnity/Resources/WalletConnectProjectConfig` asset.
   - If you don’t have a Project ID, you can create one at [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com).
   - The `Redirect` fields are optional. They are used to redirect the user back to your app after they approve or reject the session.
2. Initialize `WalletConnect` and get reference to the instance of `Core`:

```csharp
// Initialize singleton
await WalletConnect.Instance.InitializeAsync();

// Or handle instancing manually
var walletConnectUnity = new WalletConnect();
await walletConnectUnity.InitializeAsync();

var core = WalletConnect.Instance.SignClient.Core;
```

## Usage

<PlatformTabs

<PlatformTabItem value="web">

The methods listed below are limited to only the public methods of the Pairing API that we recommend you interact with directly.
For an exhaustive list, please refer to the spec and/or implementation linked under [Useful Links](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/core/pairing/pairing-methods) above.

The keyword `sdkClient` is used here as a placeholder for any WalletConnect SDK that implements the Pairing API (e.g. `signClient`, `authClient`, etc).

```ts
 // Creates a new (inactive) pairing. Returns the URI for a peer to consume via `pair`, as well as the pairing topic.
const {topic, uri} = await sdkClient.core.pairing.create()

// Pair with a peer's proposed pairing, extracted from the provided `uri` parameter.
await sdkClient.core.pairing.pair({ uri: "wc:1b3eda3f4..." })

// Activate a previously created pairing (e.g. after the peer has paired), by providing the pairing topic.
await sdkClient.core.pairing.activate({ topic: "1b3eda3f4..." })

// Updates the expiry of an existing pairing, by providing the pairing topic and an `expiry` in seconds (e.g. `60` for one minute from now)
await sdkClient.core.pairing.updateExpiry({ topic: "1b3eda3f4...", expiry: 60 })

// Updates a pairing's metadata, by providing the pairing topic and the desired metadata.
await sdkClient.core.pairing.updateMetadata({ topic: "1b3eda3f4...", metadata: { name: "MyDapp", ... } })

// Returns an array of all existing pairings.
const pairings = sdkClient.core.pairing.getPairings()

// Pings a pairing's peer, by providing the pairing topic.
await sdkClient.core.pairing.ping({ topic: "1b3eda3f4..." })

// Disconnects/Removes a pairing, by providing the pairing topic.
await sdkClient.core.pairing.disconnect({ topic: "1b3eda3f4..." })
```

#### Listeners for pairing-related events

The Pairing API currently emits the following events:

- `pairing_ping`
- `pairing_delete`
- `pairing_expire`

Any of these events can be listened for via the standard Node [`EventEmitter` interface](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter):

```ts
sdkClient.core.pairing.events.on('pairing_delete', ({ id, topic }) => {
  // clean up after the pairing for `topic` was deleted.
})
```

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

Create an AppMetadata object. It will describe your application and define its appearance in a web browser.

Starting from WalletConnect SDK version 1.9.5, the `redirect` field in the `AppMetadata` object is mandatory. Ensure that the provided value matches your app's URL scheme to prevent redirection-related issues.

Then configure the Pair instance with a metadata object you have instantiated.

```swift
let metadata = AppMetadata(name: <String>,
                           description: <String>,
                           url: <String>,
                           icons: <[String]>,
                           redirect: AppMetadata.Redirect(native: "example://", universal: nil))

Pair.configure(metadata: metadata)
```

#### Pairing Wallet Usage

In pair wallet with dapp, the user needs to scan a QR code or open a deep link generated by dapp, then instantiate `WalletConnectURI` from the scanned QR code string and call the `pair()` function as follows.

```swift
let uri WalletConnectURI(string: <String>)
try! await Pair.instance.pair(uri: uri)
```

Now wallet and a dapp have a secure communication channel that will be used by top level APIs.

#### Pairing Dapp Usage

In order to pair dapp and a wallet, dapp needs to generate and share a uri with wallet.
To generate a uri call `create()` function on Pair instance as follows.

```swift
let uri = try await Pair.instance.create()
```

Now you can share the uri with the wallet.

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

#### **Create Pairing**

```kotlin
val pairing: Pairing? = CoreClient.Pairing.create() { error -> }
```

When first establishing a pairing with a Peer, call `CoreClient.Pairing.create`. This will try and generate a new pairing with a URI parameter that can be used to establish a connection with the other Peer as well as other meta data related to the pairing.

#

#### **Pair Clients**

```kotlin
val pairingParams = Core.Params.Pair(pairingUri)
CoreClient.Pairing.pair(pairingParams) { error -> }
```

To pair the wallet with the Dapp, call the CoreClient.Pairing's pair function which needs a `Core.Params.Pair` parameter. `Core.Params.Pair` is where the WC Uri will be passed.

#

#### **Get List of Active Pairings**

```kotlin
val listOfActivePairings: List<Core.Model.Pairing> = CoreClient.Pairing.getPairings()
```

To get a list of the most current active pairings, call `CoreClient.Pairing.getPairings()` which will return a list of type `Core.Model.Pairing`.

#

#### **Disconnect a Pairing**

```kotlin
CoreClient.Pairing.disconnect(topic = /*Pairing topic*/") { error -> }
```

To disconnect from a pairing, just pass the topic of the pairing to disconnect from (use `getPairings()` to get a list of all active pairings and their topics).

#### Pairing Wallet Usage

When paring a wallet with a dapp, the user needs to scan a QR code or open a deep link generated by the dapp. Grab the string from the scanned QR code string or from the deep link and call the `Pair()` function as follows.

```csharp
var uri = "...";
PairingStruct pairingData = await core.Pairing.Pair(uri);
```

Now the wallet and a dapp have a secure communication channel that will be used by top level APIs.

#### Pairing Dapp Usage

In order to pair dapp and a wallet, dapp needs to generate and share a uri with wallet. To generate a uri call `create()` function on Pair instance as follows.

```csharp

var pairData = await core.Pairing.Create();
string topic = pairData.Topic;
string uri = pairData.Uri;
```

Now you can share the uri with the wallet either through a QR Code or by using a deep link.

#### Message Sending / Handling

Once a wallet and dapp has been paired, they can send messages securely to the pairing topic.

Requests can be received from the dapp by handling the message callback in the `MessageHandler` module.

```csharp
core.MessageHandler.MessageEventHandler<MyRequest, MyResponse>()
    .FilterRequests(r => r.Topic == pairingData.Topic)
    .OnRequest +=
		async delegate(RequestEventArgs<MyRequest, MyResponse> eventArgs)
		{
		    Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.Request);
		    eventArgs.Response = new MyResponse()
		    {
		        // ...
		    };
		};
```

A response can be sent for any request by setting the `Response` field in the `eventArgs` parameter.

Receiving responses is handled the same way, but instead of the `OnRequest` event you would use the `OnResponse` event.

Request, Responses and Errors can be sent using the `SendRequest` , `SendResult` and `SendError` functions in the `MessageHandler` module.

```csharp
long id = await core.MessageHandler.SendRequest<MyRequest, MyResponse>(pairingTopic, data);
```
