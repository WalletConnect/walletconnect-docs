# Getting Started

## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows you to connect your mobile wallet
to different decentralized applications and other wallets. Historically this has been done through a QR code, which establishes a
secure end-to-end encrypted connection between the two devices. This allows you to interact with dapps and sign transactions securely from your mobile wallet.

## WalletConnect SDKs

WalletConnect provides a suite of SDKs to help you build your dapp or wallet. Whether you're a dapp developer or a wallet developer, we've got you covered.

## Advanced Usage

### Chain Onboarding

The WalletConnect protocol is multi-chain by design.
By using the [CAIP-25 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md), WalletConnect aims to provide a standardized process for onboarding new chains into our ecosystem.
To get started, refer to our [Chain Onboarding Guide](/advanced/multichain/overview).

### Providers

WalletConnect offers two types of providers for interactions: EthereumProvider and UniversalProvider.

#### EthereumProvider

EthereumProvider is a provider that is designed to work with Ethereum-compatible chains.
More information about EthereumProvider can be found [here](/advanced/providers/ethereum)
