# Getting Started

## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows you to connect your mobile wallet
to different decentralized applications and other wallets. Historically this has been done through a QR code, which establishes a
secure end-to-end encrypted connection between the two devices. This allows you to interact with dapps and sign transactions securely from your mobile wallet.

## WalletConnect SDKs

WalletConnect provides a suite of SDKs to help you build your dapp or wallet. Whether you're a dapp developer or a wallet developer, we've got you covered.

## WalletConnect Cloud

[WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) app is exclusively for developers, and is used for project and explorer management.
It allows you to create, manage and view analytics for your projects. You can also submit your project to the WalletConnect explorer for users to discover.

## WalletConnect Explorer

[WalletConnect Explorer](https://explorer.walletconnect.com) allows users to discover WalletConnect-enabled dapps and wallets.
For developers, [Explorer API](/cloud/explorer) currently offers the following functionality:

- **Listings** : Allows for fetching of wallets and dApps listed in the WalletConnect Cloud Explorer.
- **Logos** : Provides logo assets in different sizes for a given Cloud explorer entry.

## Advanced Usage

### Chain Onboarding

The WalletConnect protocol is multi-chain by design.
By using the [CAIP-25 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md), WalletConnect aims to provide a standardized process for onboarding new chains into our ecosystem.
To get started, refer to our [Chain Onboarding Guide](/cloud/chains/overview).

### Providers

WalletConnect offers two types of providers for interactions: EthereumProvider and UniversalProvider.

#### EthereumProvider

EthereumProvider is a provider that is designed to work with Ethereum-compatible chains.
More information about EthereumProvider can be found [here](/advanced/providers/ethereum)

#### UniversalProvider

UniversalProvider is a provider that is designed to work with any blockchain that adheres to the [CAIP-25 Standards](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-25.md).
More information about UniversalProvider can be found [here](/advanced/providers/universal)

### WalletConnectModal
