# About Web3Modal

:::info
WalletConnect is undergoing protocol migration from v1 to v2, you can learn more in [this blog post](https://medium.com/walletconnect/how-to-prepare-for-the-walletconnect-v1-0-shutdown-1a954da1dbff).
Web3Modal supports both of these protocol versions and makes it easy to switch to v2 once all your target wallets support it.
:::

Web3Modal is a versatile UI library built on top of [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) and other popular wallet providers and SDKs.
It is designed to make complex tasks like connecting wallets, performing transactions and managing accounts easy.
Built on top of latest web standards, Web3Modal is lightweight, performant, tree-shakable and much more.
