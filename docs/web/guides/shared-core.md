# Shared Core Instance

WalletConnect's SDKs are designed to share common logic and resources via the `@walletconnect/core` package.

**If you intend to leverage multiple SDKs together (e.g. Sign + Auth), it is highly recommended to instantiate
a single `Core` instance and pass it to the relevant SDKs.** This avoids each SDK creating its own `Core` instance,
and thus duplicating computation, memory allocation, event listeners etc.

In the following example, we first instantiate a `Core` instance, and then proceed to instantiate both the Sign
and Auth SDK with this shared `Core`:

```ts
import { Core } from "@walletconnect/core";
import SignClient from "@walletconnect/sign-client";
import { AuthClient } from "@walletconnect/auth-client";

// First instantiate a separate `Core` instance.
const core = new Core({
  projectId: "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
});

const metadata = {
  name: "Example Dapp",
  description: "Example Dapp",
  url: "#",
  icons: ["https://walletconnect.com/walletconnect-logo.png"],
};

// Pass `core` to the SignClient on init.
const signClient = await SignClient.init({ core, metadata });

// Pass `core` to the AuthClient on init.
const authClient = await AuthClient.init({ core, metadata });
```
