import ObtainProjectIdPartial from '../../web3modal/_partials/obtainProjectId.mdx'

# Installation

WalletConnectModal is a simple ui library intended for advanced use cases where users manage connections strings and associated WalletConnect API's themselves.

## Obtain Project ID

<ObtainProjectIdPartial />

## Add packages (NPM)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/modal
```

## Add packages (CDN)

WalletConnectModal uses [unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com/) as its official CDN provider.
Instead of using the npm package, you can simply import it from their CDN and use it in the same way.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { WalletConnectModal } from 'https://unpkg.com/@walletconnect/modal'
</script>
```

## Implementation

Start by importing `WalletConnectModal` and initializing it.

```js
import { WalletConnectModal } from '@walletconnect/modal'

const modal = new WalletConnectModal({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  chains: ['eip155:1'],
  walletConnectVersion: 2
})
```

## Trigger the modal

Once you have obtained your connection uri, you can open or close the modal.

From here on, use `provider` as you normally would, WalletConnectModal will be shown and hidden automatically i.e.

```js
await modal.openModal({
  uri: 'YOUR_CONNECTION_URI'
})

// Do some work...

modal.closeModal()
```
