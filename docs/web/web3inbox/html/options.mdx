## Event Handlers

The following events are fired and need to be handled for the widget to work:

### `connectRequest`: ()
No params are needed here, it's just used to trigger the dapp's connection modal.

### `signMessage`: ({detail: {message: string, sendSignature: (signature: string) => void}}) 
This is used to handle signature requests coming from the widget, where the message lives in
`detail.message` and the signature needs to be sent back to the widget using `detail.sendSignature`.
