# Push Server

The Push Server sends WalletConnect protocol activity using FCM or APNs to users. The Push Server can be used with our [Notify API](../web3wallet/notify/introduction.mdx) and [Web3Wallet SDK](../web3wallet/about.mdx).

Several options exist for setting up the Push Server:

1. Using [WalletConnect Cloud](#setup-in-walletconnect-cloud) (recommended)
2. Self-host the [Push Server](https://github.com/WalletConnect/push-server)
3. Write your own implementation using the [spec](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/servers/push/spec)

It is recommended that you use WalletConnect Cloud for simplicity and ease of integration. Typically you only need to self-host if you have concerns about our hosted platform having access to your FCM or APNs server credentials, such as for regulatory reasons. If you want to self-host or implement against the spec, please reach out to devrel@walletconnect.com for assistance.

## Setup in WalletConnect Cloud

1. Create a Project in the Cloud App. Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and sign up for an account.

2. To get your project's Push URL, from the Cloud App, go into the settings tab and click on `Create Push URL`.

3. From the same settings tab, you will see the FCM and the APNS settings becomes available to setup. Add your [FCM](#firebase-cloud-messaging-fcm) and/or [APNs](#apple-push-notifications-apns) details.

### Firebase Cloud Messaging API (FCM v1)

- In your Firebase project settings, under _Firebase Cloud Messaging API (V1)_, click the Manage Service Accounts link
- You may use the default `firebase-adminsdk` service account, but we recommend making a minimally privileged service account:
  - Click the _Create service account_ button
  - Provide an arbitrary name and ID. E.g. `WalletConnect Cloud Push Server` and click _Create and Continue_
    ![Provide a name](/assets/push-fcmv1-create-sa.png)
  - Click Done
- Next create keys for the service account by clicking on the `â‹®` button next to the service account and selecting _Manage keys_
  - Click _Add key_ -> _Create new key_
  - Select _JSON_ and click _Create_
  - A `.json` file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded to your computer
- Upload the credentaials JSON file to your Cloud project's settings

### Cloud Messaging API (FCM Legacy)

:::caution
FCM Legacy is deprecated and [will be removed in June 2024](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1). We strongly encourage you to setup FCM v1 (above) instead.

When FCM v1 is enabled in WalletConnect Cloud, it will replace the use of the legacy FCM API. No migration of devices/apps is necessary.
:::

Google's FCM allows you to use send notifications to both Android and Apple devices. At this time, we only support apps using the FCM client API.

- Enable Legacy Cloud Messaging API in the Firebase project settings
  ![legacy-fcm-cloud-messaging](/assets/legacy-fcm-cloud-messaging-api.png)
- [Set up Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client)
- [Set up Apple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client)

### Apple Push Notifications (APNs)

Apple recommends using a Token-Based Connection for APNS over a Certificate-Based connection. Please refer to their documentation for instructions on obtaining either.

- [Token-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns)
- [Certificate-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)
