# Introduction

:::info

Web3Modal SDK v3 is out! Learn how to integrate it [here](../../web3modal/about.mdx)

:::

WalletConnectModal is a simple ui library intended for advanced use cases where users manage connections strings and associated WalletConnect API's themselves.

<CloudBanner />

## Installation

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="wcm"
	activeOptions={["web","ios","android", "react-native","flutter","unity"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

#### Add packages (NPM)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/modal
```

#### Add packages (CDN)

WalletConnectModal uses [unpkg](https://www.unpkg.com/) as its official CDN provider.
Instead of using the npm package, you can simply import it from their CDN and use it in the same way.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { WalletConnectModal } from 'https://unpkg.com/@walletconnect/modal'
</script>
```

:::caution
**The WalletConnectModal SDK is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

It's public API and associated documentation may still see significant and breaking changes.
:::

#### SwiftPackageManager

You can add a WalletConnect SDK to your project with Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open XCode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub url: https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2
4. Tap Add Package
5. Choose the WalletConnectV2 products that you want installed in your app.

#### Alternatively, add WalletConnectModal to a `Package.swift` manifest

To integrate via a `Package.swift` manifest instead of Xcode, you can add
WalletConnectModal to the dependencies array of your package:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(
    name: "WalletConnectV2",
    url: "https://github.com/WalletConnectV2/WalletConnectSwiftV2.git",
    .upToNextMajor(from: "1.6.4")
  ),

  // Any other dependencies you have...
],
```

Then, in any target that depends on a WalletConnectV2 product, add it to the `dependencies`
array of that target:

```swift
.target(
  name: "MyTargetName",
  dependencies: [
    // The product(s) you want (e.g. WalletConnectModal).
    .product(name: "WalletConnectModal", package: "WalletConnectV2"),
  ]
),
```

<TabItem value="rn-cli" label="React Native CLI">

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/modal-react-native
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, modals and SVG's.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-modal react-native-svg @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

On iOS, use CocoaPods to add the native modules to your project:

```
npx pod-install
```

#### (Optional) Enable Wallet Detection

To enable WalletConnectModal to detect wallets installed on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native code of your project.

##### For iOS:

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>safe</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <string>uniswap</string>
  <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
</array>
```

##### For Android:

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Locate the `<queries>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet package names as `<package>` entries within the `<queries>`. These package names correspond to the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [AndroidManifest.xml example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) for detailed guidance.

Example:

```xml
<queries>
  <package android:name="io.metamask"/>
  <package android:name="com.wallet.crypto.trustapp"/>
  <package android:name="io.gnosis.safe"/>
  <package android:name="me.rainbow"/>
  <!-- Add other wallet package names here -->
</queries>
```

Important Note: The WalletConnect SDK will only be able to detect the wallets that you explicitly list in your native files. Make sure to include all the relevant wallet schemes/packages you want to support.

For additional wallet schemes and package names, you can explore our [Explorer API](../../cloud/explorer.md). This API offers an up-to-date list of wallet identifiers that you can integrate into your project for enhanced wallet detection.

<TabItem value="expo" label="Expo">

```
npx expo install @walletconnect/modal-react-native
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, modals and SVG's.

```
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-modal react-native-svg @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

<details>
<summary>Additional setup for Expo SDK 48 only</summary>
<div>

If you are using Expo SDK 48, you also need to polyfill `crypto` with expo-crypto library.

1. Add `expo-crypto`

```
npx expo install expo-crypto
```

2. Create a file named `crypto-polyfill.js`

```js
// src/crypto-polyfill.js

// Apply only with Expo SDK 48
import { getRandomValues as expoCryptoGetRandomValues } from 'expo-crypto'

class Crypto {
  getRandomValues = expoCryptoGetRandomValues
}

// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef
const webCrypto = typeof crypto !== 'undefined' ? crypto : new Crypto()

;(() => {
  if (typeof crypto === 'undefined') {
    Object.defineProperty(window, 'crypto', {
      configurable: true,
      enumerable: true,
      get: () => webCrypto
    })
  }
})()
```

3. Import `crypto-polyfill.js` in your App root file

```js
import './crypto-polyfill.js'
...
import { useWalletConnectModal } from '@walletconnect/modal-react-native';
```

</div>
</details>

#### (Optional) Enable Wallet Detection (iOS Only)

To enable WalletConnectModal to detect wallets installed on the device in your Expo project for iOS, follow these steps:

1. Open your `app.json` (or `app.config.js`) file.
2. Locate the ios section within the configuration.
3. Add the `infoPlist` object if it doesn't exist, and within it, include the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` array. This array will contain the desired wallet schemes you want to detect.
4. Add the wallet schemes to the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` array.

Your configuration should look like this:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.your.app",
      "infoPlist": {
        "LSApplicationQueriesSchemes": [
          "metamask",
          "trust",
          "safe",
          "rainbow",
          "uniswap"
          // Add other wallet schemes names here
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configuring wallet detection for Android is not supported through Expo, as there's no direct way to add the required queries. This configuration is specifically for iOS in an Expo project.

Important Note: The WalletConnect SDK will only be able to detect the wallets that you explicitly list in your native files. Make sure to include all the relevant wallet schemes you want to support.

For additional wallet schemes, you can explore our [Explorer API](../../cloud/explorer.md). This API offers an up-to-date list of wallet identifiers that you can integrate into your project for enhanced wallet detection.
