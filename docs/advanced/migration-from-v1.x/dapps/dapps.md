### web3-provider

If you are using `@walletconnect/web3-provider`, we stopped supporting this provider in favor of the improved version published under `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider` and you will be able to check the latest version on NPM [here](https://npmjs.com/package/@walletconnect/ethereum-provider).

### ethereum-provider

:::caution

For usage with Typescript, make sure you are using Typescript version `5.0.0` or higher.

:::

- Ensure you have a `projectId` from the WalletConnect Cloud. You can get one [here](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).
- Upgrade `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider` from `1.x.x` to `2.x.x`.

Previously, you would have passed in an `infuraId` like:

```typescript
import WalletConnectProvider from '@walletconnect/ethereum-provider'

const web3Provider = new WalletConnectProvider({
  infuraId: 'INFURA_ID'
})
```

The new implementation requires `projectId` and `chains` instead. Here is an example of the new initialization:

```typescript
import { EthereumProvider } from '@walletconnect/ethereum-provider'

const provider = await EthereumProvider.init({
  projectId: 'WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID', // required
  chains: [1], // required
  showQrModal: true // requires @walletconnect/modal
})
```

- Install `@walletconnect/modal` if you want to use the QR Code modal. You can find more information about WalletConnectModal [here](../../walletconnectmodal/about.mdx).

### Web3Modal v1.0

We recommend that you replace your existing integration with the latest version of Web3Modal by following one of these paths:

- [Web3Modal](../../../web3modal/about.mdx): Web3modal feature rich modal with [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), has WalletConnect, extension wallets, connectors, chain switching, account modal and more.
- [WalletConnectModal](../../walletconnectmodal/about.mdx): WalletConnectModal is a lightweight modal to add into your existing workflows.

### Web3Modal v2.0

If you are using our redesigned Web3Modal (often referred to as Web3Modal v2.0), you are ready to go. Please ensure that you are using a minimum version of `2.6.0`. Here is a code example:

```typescript
import { w3mConnectors, w3mProvider } from '@web3modal/ethereum'
import { createConfig } from 'wagmi'

// ...
const { publicClient } = configureChains(chains, [w3mProvider({ projectId })])

const config = createConfig({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [
    w3mConnectors({
      projectId,
      chains
    })
  ],
  publicClient
})

const ethereumClient = new EthereumClient(config, chains)
// ...
```

For more documentation, follow the docs for Web3Modal [here](../../../web3modal/about.mdx).

### react-native-dapp

We are currently developing our new SDK [`@walletconnect/modal-react-native`](../../walletconnectmodal/about.mdx), which is now available in release-candidate version.

To ensure a seamless transition, we have developed a comprehensive example [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/compare/deprecated-example...deprecated-migration) that simplifies the migration process.

Follow this steps along with the migration example:

1. Remove `@walletconnect/react-native-dapp` and all it's implementation
2. Remove `crypto` polyfill and `rn-nodeify` logic (if present)
3. Install new packages: `yarn add @walletconnect/modal-react-native react-native-get-random-values react-native-modal react-native-svg @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-community/netinfo`
4. If the project uses react native < 0.70, install `big-integer` and add `BigInt` polyfill
5. Run `pod install` in `/ios`

You can also find detailed documentation on how to install & utilize the new SDK [here](../../walletconnectmodal/about.mdx).

The latest SDK introduces a powerful combination of [Universal Provider](../../providers/universal.md) and our [Cloud Explorer API](../../../cloud//explorer.md). This integration forms the solid foundation for a React Native dapp to effortlessly connect with wallets."

If you need assistance at any point during the migration process, please feel free to reach out to us via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/WalletConnect/discussions).

### web3-onboard

If you are using the WalletConnect package with [Blocknative's web3-onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/wallets/walletconnect#install), the migration is straightforward. The latest WalletConnect package is backwards-compatible (until the WalletConnect v1.0 shutdown comes into effect).
When you are ready to transition, bump the `@web3-onboard/walletconnect` package version to >= `2.3.0` and adjust the initialization params:

```typescript
const walletConnect = walletConnectModule({
  version: 2, // **New Param** Defaults to version: 1 - this behavior will be deprecated after the WalletConnect v1 sunset
  handleUri: uri => console.log(uri),
  projectId: '', // ***New Param* Project ID associated with [WalletConnect account](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
  requiredChains: [1, 56] // chains required to be supported by WC wallet
})

// for optional chains/optionalNamespaces
const onboard = Onboard({
  wallets: [walletConnect],
  chains: [
    // chains that are passed as optional chains to WC wallet after cleaning and parsing as number[]
    {
      id: '0x89',
      token: 'MATIC',
      label: 'Polygon',
      rpcUrl: 'https://matic-mainnet.chainstacklabs.com'
    }
    // ...
  ]
})
```

_Note: The `@web3-onboard/walletconnect` package will default to `version` 1 until the WalletConnect v1 sunset is complete_

### Dynamic

Switching to WalletConnect v2.0 is straightforward using [Dynamic](https://www.dynamic.xyz/). To upgrade, ensure you are using v0.15 or later for `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react`. Once set up, visit your Dynamic developer dashboard and head to the integrations page. Select the WalletConnect card, toggle v2.0 on and add your WalletConnect `project ID`. Once enabled, Dynamic will automatically use WalletConnect v2.0 for wallets that support it, and v1.0 for wallets that donâ€™t.

### solana-labs/wallet-adapter

If you are using `solana-labs/wallet-adapter`, this is already working on WalletConnect v2.0, so there is nothing to change here. There will be a new version released with an updated UI modal shortly.

### web3-react

[web3-react](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react) has created their own modules for WalletConnect v2.0. You can test their playground [here](https://web3-react-mu.vercel.app/) and read their example implementation [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/main/example/connectors/walletConnectV2.ts). In order to get started with the migration, we suggest upgrading your `@web3-react/types`, `@web3-react/store` and `@web3-react/core` as well as installing `@web3-react/walletconnect-v2`.

After you have the respective packages, you will have to obtain a projectId from the WalletConnect Cloud and add it your `.env` file.

You will need to then initialize WalletConnect v2.0 as a connector as referenced [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/main/example/components/connectorCards/WalletConnectV2Card.tsx).

```typescript
import { initializeConnector } from '@web3-react/core'
import { WalletConnect as WalletConnectV2 } from '@web3-react/walletconnect-v2'

import { MAINNET_CHAINS } from '../chains'

const [mainnet, ...optionalChains] = Object.keys(MAINNET_CHAINS).map(Number)

export const [walletConnectV2, hooks] = initializeConnector<WalletConnectV2>(
  actions =>
    new WalletConnectV2({
      actions,
      options: {
        projectId: process.env.walletConnectProjectId,
        chains: [mainnet],
        optionalChains,
        showQrModal: true
      }
    })
)
```

Note: Be sure to test with several chains in order to complete your implementation of WalletConnect v2.0.

Then use the `@web3-react/walletconnect-v2` package with the following methods in your components.

- `URIListener`: Event listener for when v2 URI is created. Code reference [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/3781fe453c88c7cd6a0fd12c77192ef17dd07619/example/components/connectorCards/WalletConnectV2Card.tsx#L26).
- `activate`: Create a session pairing with WalletConnect v2. Code reference [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/3781fe453c88c7cd6a0fd12c77192ef17dd07619/packages/walletconnect-v2/src/index.ts#L133).
- `deactivate`: Disconnect your session from your wallet. Code reference [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/3781fe453c88c7cd6a0fd12c77192ef17dd07619/packages/walletconnect-v2/src/index.ts#L171).
- `connectEagerly`: Connect to v2 protocol on mount. Code reference [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/3781fe453c88c7cd6a0fd12c77192ef17dd07619/packages/walletconnect-v2/src/index.ts#L113).

Sample codes of reference can be found in:

- [WalletConnectV2Card.tsx](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/main/example/components/connectorCards/WalletConnectV2Card.tsx)
- [CardWithSelect.tsx](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react/blob/main/example/components/ConnectWithSelect.tsx)

### ConnectKit

To migrate to WalletConnect v2.0 using ConnectKit, you need to upgrade `connectkit` and `wagmi` to the latest version.

:::caution

WalletConnect V2 is only supported in ConnectKit v1.3.0 and above

:::

:::info

For version 1.4.0 and above, you need to remove `ethers` and install `viem` instead.

```bash
yarn remove ethers
yarn add wagmi@latest viem@latest
```

:::

Run the following command to install it using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add connectkit@^latest wagmi@^latest
```

WalletConnect v2.0 requires a projectId to be set and included in the configuration.
You can easily get a `projectId` by creating an account on the [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

Create a new environment variable `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in your `.env` file and set it to your projectId.

```bash
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Next, update your code by including the `walletConnectProjectId` inside the config object for `getDefaultClient`:

```typescript
...
const client = createClient(
  getDefaultClient({
    ...
+    walletConnectProjectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
    ...
  }),
);
...
```

Note:

- For a version specific upgrade, refer to the [official migration guide](https://docs.family.co/connectkit/migration-guide#migration-guide) from Family.
- When customizing your configuration for advanced usage, it is important to include the `projectId` within your `WalletConnectConnector` object. You can learn more about it [here](https://wagmi.sh/react/connectors/walletConnect#projectid).
- Make sure you have compatible versions of ethers and viem. Check your project's dependencies to ensure compatibility with ConnectKit.

For a comprehensive example, refer to the provided sample code:

- [ConnectKit with Next.js](https://github.com/family/connectkit/tree/main/examples/nextjs)
- [ConnectKit with React (Vite)](https://github.com/family/connectkit/tree/main/examples/vite)
- [ConnectKit with React (CRA)](https://github.com/family/connectkit/tree/main/examples/cra)

### wagmi

To migrate to WalletConnect v2.0 using wagmi, you need to upgrade `wagmi` to either `0.12.16` if you are using `ethers` or `1.x.x` if you are using `viem`.

:::caution

WalletConnect v2.0 is only supported in wagmi `0.12.8` and above.

:::

#### Upgrading to wagmi `0.12.16`

Run the following command to install it using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add wagmi@^0.12.16
```

WalletConnect v2.0 requires a projectId to be set and included in the configuration.
You can easily get a `projectId` by creating an account on the [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

Create a new environment variable `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in your `.env` file and set it to your projectId.

```bash
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Next, update your code by including the `walletConnectProjectId` inside the config object for `WalletConnectConnector`:

```typescript
import { WalletConnectConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/walletConnect'

const connector = new WalletConnectConnector({
  options: {
    projectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
    showQrModal: true
  }
})

const client = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  provider,
  connectors: [connector],
});

...
```

#### Upgrading to wagmi `1.x.x`

wagmi 1.x.x drops support for `ethers` and only supports `viem`. If you are using `ethers`, you will need to migrate to `viem` before upgrading to wagmi `1.x.x`.

```bash
yarn remove ethers
yarn add wagmi viem@latest
```

WalletConnect v2.0 requires a projectId to be set and included in the configuration.
You can easily get a `projectId` by creating an account on the [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

Create a new environment variable `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in your `.env` file and set it to your projectId.

```bash
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Next, update your code by including the `walletConnectProjectId` inside the config object for `WalletConnectConnector`:

```typescript
import { createConfig, configureChains, mainnet } from 'wagmi'
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public'
import { WalletConnectConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/walletConnect'

const { chains, publicClient } = configureChains([mainnet], [publicProvider()])

const connector = new WalletConnectConnector({
  chains,
  options: {
    projectId: process.env.WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID,
  },
}),

const config = createConfig({
  connectors: [connector],
  publicClient,
})

...
```

wagmi `1.x.x` introduces several breaking changes due to the migration from `ethers` to `viem`.
For a version-specific upgrade, refer to:

- [Official migration guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide) for wagmi
- [ethers.js -> viem migration guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide) for viem

### RainbowKit

If you've already adopted RainbowKit `0.12.x` and `1.0.x`, then you're almost there! Just upgrade to the latest RainbowKit patch release and give it a try. RainbowKit has been API compatible with WalletConnect v2 since `0.12.8` was released in April.

RainbowKit has enabled WalletConnect v2 by default with `0.12.15` and `1.0.2`. RainbowKit will continue to support `0.12.x` in case your dApp has not yet upgraded to Wagmi and RainbowKit v1.

**1. Upgrading dependencies**

```bash
npm i @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@^1.0.2 wagmi@^1.2
```

If you're using a version of RainbowKit before `0.12.x` or `1.0.x`, just follow the [Migration Guides](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/migration-guide) to get up-to-date.

It is recommended that `0.12.x` dApps also begin to upgrade [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/migration-guide), as improvements to WalletConnect v2 will only be included in future versions of wagmi.

**2. Supplying a projectId**

Every dApp that relies on WalletConnect now needs to obtain a `projectId` from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). This is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.

Supply your `projectId` to `getDefaultWallets` and individual RainbowKit wallet connectors like the following:

```ts
const projectId = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
const { wallets } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'My RainbowKit App',
  projectId,
  chains
})
const connectors = connectorsForWallets([
  ...wallets,
  {
    groupName: 'Other',
    wallets: [
      argentWallet({ projectId, chains }),
      trustWallet({ projectId, chains }),
      ledgerWallet({ projectId, chains })
    ]
  }
])
```

RainbowKit is type-safe and will warn you when a `projectId` is missing. Refer to RainbowKits' examples to see v2 in action:

- [Create React App](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-create-react-app)
- [Next.js](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-next)
- [Next.js App Router](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-next-app)
- [Remix](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-remix)
- [Vite](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples/with-vite)

### Privy

To upgrade [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) to use WalletConnect v2.0, **the only thing you need to do is install the [latest version](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/changelog) of the Privy SDK:**

```sh
npm i @privy-io/react-auth@latest
```

**That's it! You've upgraded to WalletConnect v2.0.**

#### Optional

If you want to configure your own WalletConnect Cloud Project instead of using the default one provided by Privy, proceed to the following steps. This is optional.

#### 1. Get a WalletConnect Cloud Project ID

Go to [**WalletConnect Cloud**](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and create a new account. Once your account is created, create a new project and collect the **Project ID**.

#### 2. Configure your Project ID in the PrivyProvider

In the [`config`](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/interfaces/PrivyProviderProps#config) property of your [`PrivyProvider`](https://docs.privy.io/reference/react-auth/modules#privyprovider), add a `walletConnectCloudProjectId` with your project ID from step 1.

```tsx title='Example configuration of Privy with WalletConnect v2.0 in NextJS'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { PrivyProvider } from '@privy-io/react-auth'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <PrivyProvider
      appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID || ''}
      config={{
        walletConnectCloudProjectId: 'YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID'
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </PrivyProvider>
  )
}
```
