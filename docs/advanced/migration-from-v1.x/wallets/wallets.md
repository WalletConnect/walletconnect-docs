# Wallets

Wallets must support v1.0 and v2.0 in parallel. Our WalletConnect URIs are versioned and you can route the URI that was either scanned from a QR Code or redirected from a Deep Link, following the schema described in the [EIP-1328](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1328).

When your wallet receives a v2.0 URI you must route it to the correct SDK.

The following steps describe the various steps necessary for dapps to migrate to v2:
