# Migration FAQs

### Why is WalletConnect carrying out the migration to WalletConnect v2.0 - and shutting down WalletConnect v1.0?

The original WalletConnect protocol, which is often referred to as WalletConnect v1.0, was launched in 2018. Following a redesign aimed at enhancing protocol performance, WalletConnect v2.0 was launched in late 2021. This new version of the WalletConnect protocol offers improvements including multi-chain support, a new Relay URL API, and an end user experience that is faster, reliable, and more seamless.

We made the decision to shut down WalletConnect v1.0 because it is not horizontally-scalable and extremely unreliable to maintain - issues that are resolved by WalletConnect v2.0. Moreover, our intention is to one day create a decentralized WalletConnect Network anchored in the WalletConnect v2.0 protocol. However, we cannot achieve this mission if the majority of traffic still resides on WalletConnect v1.0.

We are now carrying out this migration as WalletConnect v2.0 is not backward compatible with WalletConnect v1.0, which was sunset in fall 2022. It will conclude with the shutdown of WalletConnect v1.0, which will take place at 2pm (UTC) on June 28, 2023. It is therefore necessary to migrate wallets and apps to WalletConnect v2.0 in a coordinated manner before shutdown, to ensure that there is a seamless transition and minimize any potential for disruption for end users.

### When will WalletConnect v1.0 be shut down - and what does that mean?

We will shut down WalletConnect v1.0 at 2pm (UTC) on June 28, 2023. Wallets and apps still utilizing the WalletConnect v1.0 bridge after this date will no longer be able to connect their users to another WalletConnect-supported app.

### What are the differences between WalletConnect v1.0 and v2.0?

WalletConnect v2.0 brings notable advancements to the protocol, including multi-chain support. To read more about the differences, click [here](what-changed-from-v1.0.md).

Developers getting started with WalletConnect v2.0 will also need a project ID. This project ID provides access to our infrastructure and enables enhanced insights for those that have implemented WalletConnect SDKs. You can easily obtain one by signing up on the [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

### Are WalletConnect v1.0 and v2.0 both open protocols?

Both the WalletConnect v1.0 and v2.0 protocols are open and do not enforce a single relay service. The WalletConnect v1.0 protocol can be operated as a self-hosted bridge server after our cloud-hosted v1.0 bridge servers are shut down on June 28; however, we do not recommend running them as we know how hard it is to ensure a reliable, horizontally-scalable service.

Meanwhile, we are working on making the WalletConnect v2.0 protocol self-hostable. We intend to create a federation of nodes with the launch of the fully decentralized WalletConnect Network, which will operate to maintain the same level of service as the WalletConnect Cloud while removing the central point of failure. We will provide updates on this road to decentralization as they occur.

### Can I run my own bridge server to maintain compatibility with WalletConnect v1.0?

While you can, we heavily discourage this. Not only will running your own bridge server require more effort than upgrading to WalletConnect v2.0, but there will be no scalable production code available. Please note that there are no docs available for self-hosting on WalletConnect v1.0.

If you remain interested in self-hosting, we encourage you to wait until this option becomes available for WalletConnect v2.0. WalletConnect v2.0’s design is substantially more efficient per websocket and also horizontally scalable. Not only are we able to regionalize it, but it also auto-scales based on traffic demand.

### Which wallets and apps are already on WalletConnect v2.0?

To find out which wallets and apps are already on WalletConnect v2.0, you can head over to our [Explorer page](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?version=2).

### I’m working on my WalletConnect v2.0 integration but am having technical issues. How can I get in touch with WalletConnect?

If you're experiencing technical issues, please open a discussion in our designated [support channel](https://github.com/orgs/WalletConnect/discussions/categories/v1-v2-migration-support).

### What happens if I don’t migrate in time?

If you are unable to complete your migration before the WalletConnect v1.0 shutdown comes into effect on June 28, it is likely that your users will experience connectivity issues. We therefore recommend that you begin your migration process as soon as possible, to minimize any potential impact on your user experience.

### I didn’t migrate before June 28, 2023. What should I do now?

The good news is that you’ve come to the right place! We strongly recommend that you begin your migration immediately, and you can do so by following the instructions laid out in the [migration section](./overview.md) of our docs.
