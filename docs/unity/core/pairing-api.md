# Pairing API

### Description

Pairing API is a lightweight API for establishing an encrypted, protocol-agnostic communication layer between peers. Its purpose is to provide a secure channel for proposing protocols or sending requests between dapps and wallets.

### Context

WalletConnect offers Sign, Auth, Chat and Push APIs. To allow a reusable communication channel between peers, the Pairing API exposes a standard interface and allows for sending and receiving multi-protocol requests over a single pairing.

## Pair Configuration

Create a Metadata object. It will describe your application and define its appearance in a web browser. Then configure the Pair instance with a metadata object you have instantiated.

Every project needs to obtain a Project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).

```csharp
var core = new CoreModule(new CoreOptions() { ProjectId = "...", Name = "my-app" });
core.Pairing.Configure(new Metadata()
{
    Name = "my-app",
    Description = "My app description",
    Icons = new[] { "https://walletconnect.com/meta/favicon.ico" },
    Url = "https://walletconnect.com",
});
```

## Pairing Wallet Usage

When paring a wallet with a dapp, the user needs to scan a QR code or open a deep link generated by the dapp. Grab the string from the scanned QR code string or from the deep link and call the `Pair()` function as follows.

```csharp
var uri = "...";
PairingStruct pairingData = await core.Pairing.Pair(uri);
```

Now wallet and a dapp have a secure communication channel that will be used by top level APIs. 

## Pairing Dapp Usage

In order to pair dapp and a wallet, dapp needs to generate and share a uri with wallet. To generate a uri call `create()` function on Pair instance as follows.

```csharp

var pairData = await core.Pairing.Create();
string topic = pairData.Topic;
string uri = pairData.Uri;
```

Now you can share the uri with the wallet either through a QR Code or by using a deep link. 

## Message Sending / Handling

Once a wallet and dapp has been paired, they can send messages securely to the pairing topic. 

Requests can be received from the dapp by handling the message callback in the `MessageHandler` module.

```csharp
core.MessageHandler.MessageEventHandler<MyRequest, MyResponse>()
    .FilterRequests(r => r.Topic == pairingData.Topic)
    .OnRequest +=
		async delegate(RequestEventArgs<MyRequest, MyResponse> eventArgs)
		{
		    Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.Request);
		    eventArgs.Response = new MyResponse()
		    {
		        // ...
		    };
		};
```

A response can be sent for any request by setting the `Response` field in the `eventArgs` parameter.

Receiving responses is handled the same way, but instead of the `OnRequest` event you would use the `OnResponse` event.

Request, Responses and Errors can be sent using the `SendRequest` , `SendResult` and `SendError` functions in the `MessageHandler` module.

```csharp
long id = await core.MessageHandler.SendRequest<MyRequest, MyResponse>(pairingTopic, data);
```
