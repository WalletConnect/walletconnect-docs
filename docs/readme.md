## Getting started

WalletConnect comprises four core components and associated SDKs:

- [Sign](introduction/sign.md) - a remote signer protocol to communicate securely between web3 wallets and dapps.
- [Auth](introduction/auth.md) - an authentication protocol to login wallets users into web applications. 
- [Chat](introduction/chat.md) - a direct messaging protocol that will allow wallets to message each other.
- [Push](introduction/push.md) - a push notification protocol to allow apps to notify users of both off-chain and on-chain events.

## Why use WalletConnect?

WalletConnect improves wallet-to-dapp interoperability in the web3 ecosystem. For dapps, WalletConnect can seamlessly integrate support for more than 150+ crypto wallets without much hassle. Wallets can easily integrate WalletConnect with our JavaScript, Swift or Kotlin SDK's.
