# About

Your on-ramp to web3 multichain. Web3Modal is a versatile library that makes it super easy to connect users with your Dapp and start interacting with the blockchain.
Built to be framework and chain agnostic, Web3Modal currently supports HTML and React on the UI side, as well as all evm compatible chains.

While we add support for other chains and frameworks a unique "standalone" mode is also available that unlocks you to use Web3Modal anywhere, with any framework or chain using our sign sdk.

For our supported flows, both React and HTML have great integration with [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/).
Check out [web3modal.com](https://web3modal.com) for more information and previews.
