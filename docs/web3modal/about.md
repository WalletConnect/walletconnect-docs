# About

Your on-ramp to web3 multichain. Web3Modal is a versatile library that makes it super easy to connect users with your Dapp and start interacting with the blockchain.

## Github

The Web3Modal Github can be found at [https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal).

## Customization

Web3Modal automatically adapts to display desktop or mobile wallets depending on the user's device. Furthermore, we will only show wallets that support your configured chains.

You can further customize the modal by specifying it's theme and accent color (see options below). More customization options will be added soon.
