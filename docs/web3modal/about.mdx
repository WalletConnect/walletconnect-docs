## Introduction

The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

- **Support for multiple frameworks.** Easily integrate with React, Vue, Vite, and more.
- **Customizable UI**. Choose between light and dark modes and accent colors, or even infuse it with your own branding.
