## Custom Chain Selection

You can add your own chain to extend default set of chain presets by calling the `addChainPreset(_ chain: Chain)` static method on the `Web3Modal` object.

If you modify the presets, it will be reflected in the `Web3ModalNetworkButton` button and Network selection screens.
