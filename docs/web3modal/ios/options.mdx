### Explorer recommended wallets

Allows to set default recommended wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define a list of wallets ids you'd like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

```swift
Web3Modal.configure(
    ...
    recommendedWalletIds: [String]
    ...
)
```

### Explorer excluded wallets

Allows to exclude wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define an array of wallet ids you'd like to exclude. You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

```swift
Web3Modal.configure(
    ...
    excludedWalletIds: [String]
    ...
)
```

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable Web3Modal to detect wallets installed on the device, you need to make specific changes your project Info.plist.

#### For iOS:

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:
```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>safe</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <string>uniswap</string>
  <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
</array>
```
