```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3modal/wagmi-react-native wagmi@1.4.13 viem@1.21.4

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, and SVG's.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-svg react-native-modal @react-native-community/netinfo @walletconnect/react-native-compat
```

On iOS, use CocoaPods to add the native modules to your project:

```
npx pod-install
```
