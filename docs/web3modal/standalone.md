# Standalone Usage

Web3Modal standalone is the minimal UI modal without any extras like wagmi,ethers, or injected wallet support.

## Examples

See the [react standalone](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal/tree/V2/examples/react-standalone) in the [Web3Modal examples folder](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal/tree/V2/examples) for a standalone example.

They don't controll UX. Standalone modal is just UI part of the modal without any extras like (wagmi / ethers), thus allowing them to pass in their own walletconnect uri.
