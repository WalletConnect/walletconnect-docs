# About

Standalone mode comes as a leaner version of Web3Modal that does not use [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh). It is intended for advanced use cases alongside our [Auth SDK](../../../../api/auth.md) and enables complex flows like using web3modal for non-evm chains, mixing multiple chains in one modal etc. Standalone modal comes pre-bundled in packages like [@walletconnect/ethereum-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@walletconnect/ethereum-provider).
