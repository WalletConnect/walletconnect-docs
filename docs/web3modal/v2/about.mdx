# Web3Modal v2

:::caution
 Web3Modal v2 has been deprecated, please upgrade to v3. You can find Web3Modal v3 docs [here](../about.mdx)
:::

The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

## QuickStart

<Wrapper
  type="large"
  fit={false}
  items={[
    {
      name: 'React + wagmi',
      description: 'Get started with Web3Modal and wagmi in React.',
      icon: reactLogo,
      href: './react/wagmi/installation'
    },
    {
      name: 'JavaScript + wagmi',
      description: 'Get started with Web3Modal and wagmi in JavaScript.',
      icon: javascriptLogo,
      href: './javascript/wagmi/installation'
    }
  ]}
/>

## Features

Some of the key features of the Web3Modal SDK include:

- **Support for multiple frameworks.** Easily integrate with React, Vue, Vite, and more.
- **Customizable UI**. Choose between light and dark modes and accent colors, or even infuse it with your own branding.
- **Multi-chain ready.** Easily set up support for EVM and non-EVM chains.
- **Hundreds of Wallets.** Connect with MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase and many more.
- **Built-in RPC**. Our [Blockchain API](../../cloud/blockchain-api) powers Web3Modal's RPC for balances, ENS names, and more.

## WalletConnectModal

Alternatively to **Web3Modal** you can integrate **WalletConnectModal** which is intended for advanced use cases where users manage connection strings and associated WalletConnect API's themselves.
