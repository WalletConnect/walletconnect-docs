Allows to override default recommended wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define an array of wallet ids you'd like to prioritise (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of desired wallet card. If you want to completely disable recommended wallets, you can set this option to `NONE`. Defaults to `undefined`.

```ts
explorerRecommendedWalletIds: [
  '1ae92b26df02f0abca6304df07debccd18262fdf5fe82daa81593582dac9a369',
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0'
]
// -- or -- //
explorerRecommendedWalletIds: 'NONE'
```
