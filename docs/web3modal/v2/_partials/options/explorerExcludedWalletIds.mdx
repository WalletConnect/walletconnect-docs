Allows to exclude wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define an array of wallet ids you'd like to exclude. You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of desired wallet card. If you want to exclude all wallets, you can set this option to `ALL`, however if `explorerRecommendedWalletIds` were defined, they will still be fetched. Defaults to `undefined`.

```ts
explorerExcludedWalletIds: [
  '1ae92b26df02f0abca6304df07debccd18262fdf5fe82daa81593582dac9a369',
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0'
]
// -- or -- //
explorerExcludedWalletIds: 'ALL'
```
