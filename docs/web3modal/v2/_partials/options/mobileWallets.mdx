You can define an array of custom mobile wallets. Note: you will also need to add appropriate wallet images in `walletImages`. Native link represents deeplinking URL like `rainbow://` and Universal link represent webpage link that can redirect to the app or fallback page. Defaults to `undefined`.

```ts
mobileWallets: [
  {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    links: {
      native: string
      universal: string,
    },
  },
];
```
