# QuickStart

## Web3Modal

:::info Note

This is an opinionated quickstart guide for Web3Modal using Next.js. If you are looking for a more in-depth guide for other frameworks like Vue, Vanilla JS or platforms like Android, Flutter, please refer to [Web3Modal Docs](./about).

:::

The Web3Modal SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 dapp with wallets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18.0+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [WalletConnect Cloud Account](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/?utm_source=walletconnect-docs&utm_campaign=quickstart)

### Usage

We are using [create-wc-dapp](https://github.com/WalletConnect/create-wc-dapp), the official quickstart CLI for Web3Modal from WalletConnect

```bash
npx create-wc-dapp@latest -y web3modal
cd web3modal
yarn dev
```

We are using the `-y` flag to skip the interactive prompts and use the default values. You can pass in your own values if you wish or run this command without the `-y` flag to be prompted for each value. You can also pass in the `-h` flag to see the available options.

The default values are as follows:

<Table
  headers={['Option', 'Description', 'Value']}
  data={[
    {
      option: 'Template',
      description: 'Template to use for the project',
      value: { code: 'nextjs' }
    },
    {
      option: 'Package Manager',
      description: 'Package manager to use for the project',
      value: { code: 'yarn' }
    },
    {
      option: 'Library',
      description: 'Library to use for the project. [Wagmi/Ethers]',
      value: { code: 'wagmi' }
    },
    {
      option: 'Install Dependencies',
      description: 'Whether to install dependencies after project creation',
      value: { code: 'true' }
    }
  ]}
/>

Once the app is running, you can open it in your browser at http://localhost:3000

That's it! You now have a working dapp that can connect to wallets using Web3Modal.
