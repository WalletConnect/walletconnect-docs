import { useWeb3Modal } from "@web3modal/react";

const { isOpen, open, close } = useWeb3Modal();

// Open modal (if route is not provided, modal opens view based on connection / config status)
export interface Options {
  route?: "Account" | "ConnectWallet" | "Help" | "SelectNetwork";
}

await open(options?: Options);
```

### useWeb3ModalNetwork

import { useWeb3ModalNetwork } from "@web3modal/react";

const { selectedChain, setSelectedChain } = useWeb3ModalNetwork();
```
