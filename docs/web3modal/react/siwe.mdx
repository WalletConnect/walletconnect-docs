# Sign In With Ethereum

Web3Modal SDK provides a simple solution for integrating with "Sign In With Ethereum" (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account.
SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

## Installation

Install the Web3Modal SIWE package, additionally we also recommend installing [siwe](https://docs.login.xyz/) which will abstract a lot of the required logic.

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @web3modal/siwe siwe
```

## Configure your SIWE Client

<SiweCode/>

## Initialize Web3Modal with your `siweConfig`

```ts
createWeb3Modal({
  //..
  siweConfig,
})
```

## SIWE Config Parameters
