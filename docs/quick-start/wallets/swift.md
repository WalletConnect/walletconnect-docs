# Swift Client (iOS)

Swift implementation of WalletConnect v.2 protocol for native iOS applications.

:::caution
Note: The Swift client is in Beta and should only be used for testing.
:::

## Requirements

* iOS 13
* XCode 13
* Swift 5

## Usage

#### Instantiate Client
You usually want to have a single instance of a client in you app.

```swift
let metadata = AppMetadata(name: String?,
                           description: String?,
                           url: String?,
                           icons: [String]?)
let client = WalletConnectClient(metadata: AppMetadata,
                               apiKey: String,
                               isController: Bool,
                               relayHost: String)
```

#### Pair Clients

Pair client with a uri generated by the dapp.

```swift
let uri = "wc:..."
try! client.pair(uri: uri)
```

#### Approve Session

Sessions are always proposed by the `Proposer` client so `Responder` client needs either reject or approve a session proposal.

```swift
class ClientDelegate: WalletConnectClientDelegate {
...
    func didReceive(sessionProposal: SessionProposal) {
        client.approve(proposal: proposal, accounts: [String]) { result in ... }
...
```

or

```swift
func didReceive(sessionProposal: SessionProposal) {
     client.reject(proposal: proposal, reason: Reason)
}
```

#### Handle Delegate methods

```swift
func didReceive(sessionProposal: SessionProposal) {
      // handle session proposal
 }
func didReceive(sessionRequest: SessionRequest) {
     // handle session request
 }
```

#### JSON-RPC Payloads

#### Receive
 You can parse JSON-RPC Requests received from "Requester" in `didReceive(sessionRequest: SessionRequest)` delegate function.

 Request parameters can be type casted based on request method as below:
 ```Swift
 let params = try! sessionRequest.request.params.get([EthSendTransaction].self)
 ```
 ##### Respond

 ```Swift
 let jsonrpcResponse = JSONRPCResponse<AnyCodable>(id: request.id, result: AnyCodable(responseParams))
 client.respond(topic: sessionRequest.topic, response: .response(jsonrpcResponse))
 ```
