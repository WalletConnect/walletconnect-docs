# Wallet Usage

### Initial configurations

Make sure what you properly configure Networking, Pair Clients and SignerFactory first
- [Networking](../core/networking-configuration.md)
- [Pairing](../core/pairing-usage.md)
- [SignerFactory](./signer-configuration.md)

### Instantiate a Client

Configure the `Auth` instance with Account object and your own [SignerFactory](./signer-configuration.md) implementation.

```swift
Auth.configure(
    account: Account("eip155:56:0xe5EeF1368781911d265fDB6946613dA61915a501")!,
    signerFactory: <SignerFactory>
)
```

### Completed Auth SDK Configuration:

``` swift
Networking.configure(projectId: <Project ID>, socketFactory: <SocketFactory>)
Pair.configure(metadata: <AppMetadata>)
Auth.configure(account: <Account>, signerFactory: <SignerFactory>)
```

### Subscribe for Authorization Publishers

Following publishers are available to subscribe:

```swift
public var authRequestPublisher: AnyPublisher<(request: AuthRequest, context: VerifyContext?), Never>
public var authResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<(id: RPCID, result: Result<Cacao, AuthError>), Never>
public let socketConnectionStatusPublisher: AnyPublisher<SocketConnectionStatus, Never>
```

### Authorization Requests

When your `Auth` instance receives requests or responses from a peer client, it will publish a related event. So you should set a subscription to handle them.

```swift
Auth.instance.authRequestPublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [self self] auth in
        self?.verifyDapp(auth.context)
        self?.showAuthRequest(auth.request)
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```

Auth context provides domain verification information about `AuthRequest`. It consists of the origin of a Dapp from where the request has been sent, validation `enum` that says whether origin is **unknown**, **valid** or **invalid** and verify url server. 

To enable verification you have to provide `verifyUrl` in your [AppMetadata](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/ios/core/pairing-usage#pair-configuration). To use the default verify server set this value to `verify.walletconnect.com`. To opt-out just ignore this parameter (`nil` by default).

 ```swift
public struct VerifyContext: Equatable, Hashable {
    public enum ValidationStatus {
        case unknown
        case valid
        case invalid
    }
    
    public let origin: String?
    public let validation: ValidationStatus
    public let verifyUrl: String
}
 ```

### Handle Requests from a Dapp

After pairing with dapp, your wallet will be subscribing for authentication requests. Requests will be published by `authRequestPublisher`. When a wallet receives a request, you want to present it to the user and request a signature. After the user signs the authentication message, the wallet should respond to a dapp.

`Type` parameter represent signature validation method which will be used on DApp side. Supported signature validation methods: [EIP191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191), [EIP1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271). In both cases message will be signed with [EIP191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) standard.

```swift
let signer = MessageSignerFactory.create()
let signature = try signer.sign(message: request.message, privateKey: privateKey, type: .eip191)
try await Auth.instance.respond(requestId: request.id, signature: signature)
```

In case user rejects an authentication request, call:
```swift
try await Auth.instance.reject(requestId: request.id)
```

### Get Pending Requests

if you've missed some requests you can query them with
```swift 
Auth.instance.getPendingRequests()
```
