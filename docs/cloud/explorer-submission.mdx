# Explorer Submission

:::info Note

Submitting a project to the WalletConnect Cloud Explorer is recommended but optional. You can still use WalletConnect services without submitting your project.
However, doing so ensures that your project is listed under [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?utm_source=walletconnect-docs&utm_medium=cloud&utm_campaign=explorer-submission) and [Cloud Explorer API](./explorer.md).

:::

## Creating a New Project

- Head over to [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and create a new project by clicking the "New Project" button in top right corner of the dashboard.
- Give a suitable name to your project and click the "Create" button. (You can change this later)
