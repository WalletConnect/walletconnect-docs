# Installation

## 1. Obtain Project ID

Head over to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) to sign in or sign up. Create (or use an existing) project and copy its associated Project ID. We will need this in a later step.

## 2. Install Packages

Install the WalletConnect client package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @walletconnect/auth-client
```

## 3. Initialize Client

Initialize client by passing `projectId` we created before.

```javascript
import AuthClient from "@walletconnect/auth-client";

const authClient = await AuthClient.init({
  projectId: "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>",
});
```
