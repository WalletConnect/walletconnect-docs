# Usage

:::caution
**The WalletConnect Chat SDK is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

Its public API and associated documentation may still see significant and breaking changes.
:::

:::info
For an example implementation, please refer to our [`react-wallet-chat` example (NEEDS LINK)](/).
:::

### Initialize your WalletConnect ChatClient, using [your Project ID](../../advanced/relay-server.md)

```javascript
import { ChatClient } from "@walletconnect/chat-client";

const chatClient = await ChatClient.init({
  projectId: "<YOUR PROJECT ID>",
});
```

### Set up listeners for chat-related events

```javascript
chatClient.on("chat_invite", async (event) => {
  // React to an incoming invite to chat.
});

chatClient.on("chat_joined", async (event) => {
  // React to your peer joining a given chat.
});

chatClient.on("chat_message", (event) => {
  // React to an incoming messages for a given chat.
});

chatClient.on("chat_ping", (event) => {
  // React to an incoming ping event from a peer on a given chat topic.
});

chatClient.on("chat_left", (event) => {
  // React to a peer leaving a given chat.
});
```

### Register your blockchain address with the key server

To allow for other Chat SDK user's to invite you to a chat, you need to register your account with the public key server.

The key server expects a full CAIP-2 account for the address (as shown below).

```javascript
await chatClient.register({ account: `eip155:1:0xa6de541...` });
```

### Inviting another peer to chat

To resolve a peer's public key that you will need to invite him into a chat thread, call `resolve` method.

```javascript
await chatClient.invite({
  account: `eip155:1:0xf5d44...`, // the CAIP-2 formatted account of the recipient.
  invite: {
    message: "Hey, let's chat!", // an intro message from you
    account: `eip155:1:0xa6de541...`, // your CAIP-2 formatted account that you registered previously.
  },
});
```

### Accepting an incoming invite

When your client receives an invite from a peer, you're able to accept it by calling `.accept()` with the invite's `id`.

```javascript
await chatClient.accept({ id: invite.id });
```

### Sending a chat message

To send a message to a peer in an established chat thread (i.e. after you or the peer have accepted an invite),
you can call `.message()` with the following parameters:

```javascript
await chatClient.message({
  topic: chatThread.topic, // Topic of the chat thread this message should be sent to.
  payload: {
    message: "Hey, good to hear from you!", // the message you want to send.
    authorAccount: `eip155:1:0xa6de541...`, // your CAIP-2 formatted account that you registered previously.
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  },
});
```

### Leaving a chat thread

To leave an established chat thread (deleting the thread and its associated messages), call `.leave()` with
the chat thread's topic:

```javascript
await chatClient.leave({ topic: chatThread.topic });
```
