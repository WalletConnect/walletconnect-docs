# Sign

## Introduction

WalletConnect Sign is a remote signer protocol to communicate securely between web3 wallets and dapps. The protocol establishes a remote pairing between two apps and/or devices using a Relay server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The pairing is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this pairing request.
