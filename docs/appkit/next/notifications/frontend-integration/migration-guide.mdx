# Migration Guide

## General Migration notes

- `isLimited` flag has been removed in favor of `allApps` flag. They essentially mean the opposite thing.
- Deleting messages is no longer possible
- Messages are now stored on notify server and can be paged
- Registration is more flexible since it is now split into 2 functions
