# Flutter

With Web3Modal Flutter, you can easily let people interact with multiple EVM compatible wallets and blockchains.

Let's get started with the installation and configuration!

## Installation

1.  - Add `web3modal_flutter` as dependency in your `/pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get` (check out the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/web3modal_flutter/install))
    - Or simply run `flutter pub add web3modal_flutter`
2.  - Locate your `/ios/Podfile` file and add the following as the first line:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

3.  - Run `$ pod install` inside `/ios` folder.
4.  - You should now be able to run your app with `flutter run --dart-define=PROJECT_ID={your_project_id}`

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable Web3Modal to detect wallets installed on the device, you need to make specific changes to the native sides of the project.

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="w3m_flutter"
	activeOptions={["ios","android"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.
4. Refer to our [Info.plist example file](https://github.com/WalletConnect/react-native-examples/blob/main/dapps/ModalUProvider/ios/ModalUProvider/Info.plist) for a detailed illustration.

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>metamask</string>
  <string>trust</string>
  <string>safe</string>
  <string>rainbow</string>
  <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
</array>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add your `<queries>...</queries>` schemes outside of `<application />` scope.
3. Refer to [Android Specs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/queries-element) for more information.

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="io.metamask"/>
        <package android:name="com.wallet.crypto.trustapp"/>
        <package android:name="io.gnosis.safe"/>
        <package android:name="me.rainbow"/>
        <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

### Enable Coinbase Wallet

:::info VERSION DEPENDENCY

Coinbase Wallet is available from Web3Modal **version 3.1.0** and higher

:::

Since Coinbase Wallet uses it's own SDK there are a few extra but simply steps to do if you are planning to include and support it

:::caution IMPORTANT

There is currently a bug in Coinbase's MobileWalletProtocol which fix is still under review in the following PR https://github.com/MobileWalletProtocol/wallet-mobile-sdk/pull/327 so, until this PR is merged (or the bug is fixed in any way) and a new version of their SDK is published, you will need to override `coinbase_wallet_sdk` in your **pubspec.yaml** as follows if you want to support their wallet:

```dart
dependency_overrides:
  coinbase_wallet_sdk:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/WalletConnect/wallet-mobile-sdk.git
      path: flutter
      ref: 9194f04dbaf41c12b8121f0a5f146cc7faf6b847
```

Alternatively, you can disable Coinbase Wallet support as explained in the [Disable Coinbase Wallet](#disable-coinbase-wallet) section.

:::

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="w3m_flutter"
	activeOptions={["ios","android"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="ios">

1. Open your `Info.plist` file.
2. Locate the `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
3. Include `<string>cbwallet</string>` scheme as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>cbwallet</string>
  <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
</array>
```

4. Make sure pods are installed, otherwise run `pod install` inside your `/ios` folder.
5. Open your `/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and add the following code in `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import CoinbaseWalletSDK
```

```swift
override func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}

override func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
      if (CoinbaseWalletSDK.isConfigured == true) {
        if let url = userActivity.webpageURL,
            (try? CoinbaseWalletSDK.shared.handleResponse(url)) == true {
            return true
        }
      }
    }

    return super.application(application, continue: userActivity, restorationHandler: restorationHandler)
}
```

Checkout out the [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/WalletConnect/Web3ModalFlutter/blob/master/example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift) file from our sample dapp for reference.

</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">

1. Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
2. Add `<package android:name="org.toshi"/>` scheme inside `<queries>...</queries>` as mentioned above in previous section

Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <queries>
        <package android:name="org.toshi"/>
        <!-- Any other scheme previously added -->
    </queries>

    <application>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

</PlatformTabItem>
</PlatformTabs>

### Disable Coinbase Wallet

Coinbase Wallet is enabled by default even if, in order to function properly, a few steps has to be done as described in the previous section. However, if you don't want to include/support Coinbase Wallet on your app you just need to pass Coinbase Wallet id `fd20dc426fb37566d803205b19bbc1d4096b248ac04548e3cfb6b3a38bd033aa` to [excludedWalletIds](./options#excludedwalletids) options Array.
