# Sign In With Solana

AppKit provides a simple solution for integrating with "Sign In With Solana" (SIWS), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Solana account.
SIWS is modeled [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361) (Sign In With Ethereum) and based on [CAIP122](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-122.md).

## One-Click Auth

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process in Web3Modal by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWS message with just one click.

Connecting a wallet, proving control of an address with an off-chain signature, authorizing specific actions. These are the kinds of authorizations that can be encoded as ["ReCaps"](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-222.md). ReCaps are permissions for a specific website or dapp that can be compactly encoded as a long string in the message you sign and translated by any wallet into a straight-forward one-sentence summary.
WalletConnect uses permissions expressed as ReCaps to enable a One-Click Authentication.

Install the Web3Modal SIWS package, additionally we also recommend installing [siws](https://github.com/phantom/sign-in-with-solana?tab=readme-ov-file) which will abstract a lot of the required logic.

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @web3modal/siws siws
```
