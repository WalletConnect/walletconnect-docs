# Usage

After you have installed and configured AppKit,
you can start using it to interact with the wallet provider and blockchain.

AppKit comes with the [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/) and [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) integration out of the box.

To interact with EVM chains use `Web3Modal.Evm`. Internally, AppKit will use Wagmi on WebGL or Nethereum on other platforms.
Nethereum is already preconfigured with RPC URL and interceptor that will route the requests between the wallet provider and RPC node.

## Sending Ether

To send ether, you can use the `SendTransactionAsync` method of the `Web3.Eth` class.

```csharp
const string toAddress = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045";
BigInteger amount = Web3.Convert.ToWei(0.001);
string result = await Web3Modal.Evm.SendTransactionAsync(toAddress, amount);

Debug.Log("Transaction hash: " + result);
```

This type of transaction uses the default amount of Gas 21000. Gas price is determined by the wallet provider.

## Reading Blockchain State

#### Get Ether Balance

```csharp
Account account = await Web3Modal.GetAccountAsync();
BigInteger balance = await Web3Modal.Evm.GetBalanceAsync(account.Address);

Debug.Log($"Balance: {Web3.Convert.FromWei(balance.Value)} ETH");
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

Use `ReadContractAsync` and `WriteContractAsync` methods of `Web3Modal.Evm` to interact with smart contracts.
To read or write a smart contract function, you need to provide the contract address, ABI, method name, and arguments.

### Get ERC20 Token Balance

To get the balance of an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address, ERC20 standard contract ABI, and the owner address.
This operation doesn't involve state change on the blockchain, so it's a read-only action that doesn't require a transaction.

```csharp
const string contractAddress = "0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984";
const string ownerAddress = "0x3D30B1aB88D487B0F3061F40De76845Bec3F1e94";
const string abi = "..."; // ABI of the ERC20 token contract

var evm = Web3Modal.Evm;
var balance = await evm.ReadContractAsync<BigInteger>(contractAddress, abi, "balanceOf", new object[]
{
    ownerAddress
});
var decimals = await evm.ReadContractAsync<BigInteger>(contractAddress, abi, "decimals");

var finalBalance = tokenBalance / BigInteger.Pow(10, tokenDecimal);
```

### Send ERC20 Token

To send an ERC20 token, you need to know the contract address, ERC20 standard contract ABI, recipient address, and the amount of tokens to send.
This operation requires a transaction and gas fees because it changes the state of the blockchain. User will need to confirm the transaction in the wallet.

```csharp
const string contractAddress = "0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984";
const string recipientAddress = "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045";
const string abi = "...";  // ABI of the ERC20 token contract

BigInteger amount = 1;

// Arguments for the transfer method. The order of the arguments must match the order in the method signature.
// Method signature: `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
var arguments = new object[]
{
    recipientAddress,
    amount
};
var result = await Web3Modal.Evm.WriteContractAsync(contractAddress, abi, "transfer", arguments);
```
