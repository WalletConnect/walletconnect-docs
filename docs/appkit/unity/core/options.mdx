### Explorer included wallets

Allows to set included wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define a list of wallets ids you'd like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

```csharp
await Web3Modal.InitializeAsync(new Web3ModalConfig
{
    includedWalletIds = new []
    {
        "c57ca95...74e97267d96",
    }
});
```

### Explorer excluded wallets

Allows to set excluded wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of your desired wallet card.

```csharp
await Web3Modal.InitializeAsync(new Web3ModalConfig
{
    excludedWalletIds = new []
    {
        "c57ca95...74e97267d96",
    }
});
```

### Enable Installed Wallet Detection

To enable Web3Modal to detect wallets installed on mobile devices, you need to make specific changes to the native side of the project.

<TabItem value="unity-installed-wallets-android" label="Android">

    1. In Unity [override Android Manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/overriding-android-manifest.html).
    2. Add your `<queries>...</queries>` schemes outside of `<application />` scope in the manifest file.
    3. Refer to [Android Specs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/queries-element) for more information.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

        <queries>
            <package android:name="io.metamask"/>
            <package android:name="com.wallet.crypto.trustapp"/>
            <package android:name="io.gnosis.safe"/>
            <package android:name="me.rainbow"/>
            <!-- Add other wallet schemes names here -->
        </queries>

        <application>
            ...
        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```

    More wallet package names can be found in [our sample AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectUnity/blob/project/modal-sample/Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml).

<TabItem value="unity-installed-wallets-ios" label="iOS">

    Wallet detection may produce inaccurate results on iOS Simulator. It is recommended to test on a real device.

    1. Make an iOS build.
    2. In the generated Xcode project, find `Info.plist` file and open it with a external editor (i.e. not Xcode).
    3. Locate or create `<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>` section.
    4. Add the desired wallet schemes as string entries within the `<array>`. These schemes represent the wallets you want to detect.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            ...

            <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>metamask</string>
                <string>trust</string>
                <string>safe</string>
                <string>rainbow</string>
                <string>uniswap</string>
                <string>zerion</string>
                <string>imtokenv2</string>
                <string>spot</string>
                <string>omni</string>
                <string>dfw</string>
                <string>tpoutside</string>
                <string>robinhood-wallet</string>
            </array>

            ...
        </dict>
    </plist>
    ```

### Fullscreen in WebGL

The default `unityInstance.SetFullscreen(1)` method enables fullscreen for the canvas node by pushing
it to the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer).
This causes the modal to be rendered behind the canvas, making it invisible to the user when fullscreen is enabled.

To fix this, AppKit creates a container around the canvas node and appends the modal UI to it.
By requesting fullscreen on the container, the modal will always be rendered on top of the canvas.

```javascript
// Use this instead of unityInstance.SetFullscreen(1) to enable full screen
document.querySelector('#canvas-container').requestFullscreen();
```
