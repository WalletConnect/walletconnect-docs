title: On-Ramp
---

AppKit seamlessly incorporates Coinbase Pay, enabling users to sign in to their Coinbase accounts and utilize fiat payment methods for purchasing cryptocurrencies.

:::info Note
On-Ramp is supported in the latest version of Web3Modal. If you are using an older version, make sure you upgrade.
:::

## Integration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required.

If you prefer to disable it, set the `enableOnramp` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createWeb3Modal` function.

```ts
const modal = createWeb3Modal({
  //...
  chains: [mainnet],
  projectId,
  /* highlight-add-start */
  enableOnramp: false // Optional - true by default
  /* highlight-add-end */
})
```
