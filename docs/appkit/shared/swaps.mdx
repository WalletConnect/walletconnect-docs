The Swap feature allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the AppKit modal.
This feature is designed to provide a seamless and efficient swapping experience, leveraging our collaboration with [1inch](https://1inch.io/) as the swap provider.

## Availability

- **Requirement**: The Swap feature is available only to users who log in via email or social login. This is consistent with other wallet features such as sending tokens.
- **Transaction Fee**: WalletConnect charges a 0.85% transaction fee on all swaps.
- **Supported Tokens**: The tokens available for swapping are limited to those supported by 1Inch. Note that the availability of tokens may vary depending on the network.
- **Network Availability**: The Swap feature is not available on Sepolia or other testnets at this time.

## How to Use

:::caution

## Integration

The Swaps feature is enabled by default, so no additional configuration is required.

If you prefer to disable it, set the `enableSwaps` flag to `false` in the configuration of the `createWeb3Modal` function.

```ts
const modal = createWeb3Modal({
  //...
  chains: [mainnet],
  projectId,
  /* highlight-add-start */
  enableSwaps: false // Optional - true by default
  /* highlight-add-end */
})
```
