# Email Wallets

AppKit enables passwordless Web3 onboarding and authentication, allowing your users interact with your application by creating a non-custodial wallet with just their emails.

:::info Note

Due to Safariâ€™s strict third-party cookie policies, the SDK is not preserving sessions after the app is closed. Our team is working to solve this issue soon.

## Integration

<PlatformTabs groupId="eth-lib" activeOptions={["wagmi", "ethers"]}>

<PlatformTabItem value="wagmi">
  <WagmiImplementation />
</PlatformTabItem>

<PlatformTabItem value="ethers">
  <EthersImplementation />
</PlatformTabItem>

</PlatformTabs>

## User Flow

1. Users will be able to connect to you application by simply using an email address. AppKit will send to them a One Time Password (OTP) to copy and paste in the modal, which will help to
   verify the user's authenticity. This will create a non-custodial wallet for your user which will be available in any application that integrates AppKit and email login.

2. Eventually the user can optionally choose to move from a non-custodial wallet to a self-custodial one by pressing "Upgrade Wallet" on AppKit.
   This will open the _([WalletConnect secure website](https://secure.walletconnect.com/dashboard))_ that will walk your user through the upgrading process.
