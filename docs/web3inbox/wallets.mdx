# Introduction

:::caution
Web3Inbox is in beta
:::

In order for wallets to subscribe to and receive notifications from dapps and Web3Inbox SDK, wallets must integrate Web3Wallet's [Notify API](../web3wallet/notify/introduction).

The WalletConnect Notify API allows wallet developers to build engaging notification experiences from dapps directly to wallet addresses giving the end user the ability to subscribe to and receive notifications in their wallet.
