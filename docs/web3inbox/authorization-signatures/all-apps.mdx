# Signing the message: “I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps”

When subscribing to notifications from an app that uses Web3Inbox, you may be presented with a signature request that reads the following message:

> I further authorize this app to view and manage my notifications for ALL apps. Read more at https://walletconnect.com/notifications-all-apps

For any signature request, it’s critical that you always read the message attached before signing in order to fully understand the permissions you’re granting.

Take caution when signing this request as doing so will allow the app to:

- Subscribe you to notifications from any app
- Manage your notifications for any app
- View your notifications from any app

The app will not be able to:

- Sign blockchain transactions or additional messages

Typically, apps you subscribe to for notifications will send a slightly [different request](this-app) that asks you to only authorize them to manage notifications _for that app only_ upon signing. You should only ever be presented with the message shown in the example above when an app requires wider access to your subscriptions and messages.

A common example of this would be an app that enables you to view notifications and messages from multiple apps, like a wallet or the [Web3Inbox.com app](https://app.web3inbox.com).

Always be cautious when granting this permission to an app, and ensure that you’re familiar with the app sending the request.
