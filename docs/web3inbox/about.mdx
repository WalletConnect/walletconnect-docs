## Introduction

The Web3Inbox SDK allows one to easily make use of WalletConnect's [push](../specs/clients/push/wallet-client-api.md) and [chat](../specs/clients/chat/client-api.md) SDKs. This is done by rendering a WebView of the Web3Inbox dapp.

### Features

Some of the key features of the Web3Inbox SDK include:

- **Manage what SDKs to use and UI pages to show**
- **Display push notification history**
- **Chat with peers**


### Getting Started

To get started with the Web3Modal SDK, choose the platform you'll be using to build your project. The SDK is currentl available for Web and React Native.
