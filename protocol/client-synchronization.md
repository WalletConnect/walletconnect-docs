# Client Synchronization

WalletConnect 2.0 clients will synchronize state and events for the out-of-band sequences, both session and pairing, through JSON-RPC methods which are exclusively used to communicate between the two connected clients. These will be published and subscribed under corresponding topics for both before and after settlement. This can be described under a single matrix that encompasses these two states for both sequences.

## JSON-RPC API

Below you can find all the JSON-RPC methods used between clients to synchronize state and events with corresponding interface for both request and response. Any interfaces referenced below (eg. `RelayProtocolOptions`, `PairingParticipant`, etc) refer to the same interfaces described in the [technical specification](./tech-spec.md)

### wc_pairingApprove

This request is sent as response for a pairing proposal which is signaled externally using a URI shared between clients.

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingApproveRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingApprove";
  params: {
    topic: string;
    relay: RelayProtocolOptions;
    responder: PairingParticipant;
    expiry: number;
    state: PairingState;
  };
}

// response
interface WCPairingApproveResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: true;
}
```

**NOTE:** The response for this request will serve as the acknowledgement of the proposer's pairing settlement

### wc_pairingReject

This request is sent as response for a pairing proposal which is signaled externally using a URI shared between clients.

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingRejectRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingReject";
  params: {
    reason: string;
  };
}

// response
interface WCPairingRejectResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: true;
}
```

**NOTE:** The response for this request will serve as the acknowledgement of the proposer's pairing settlement

### wc_pairingUpdate

This request is used to update state of the pairing participant which is optionally provided by the controller to share app metadata during the pairing lifetime.

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingUpdateRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingUpdate";
  params: {
    state: Partial<PairingState>;
  };
}

// response
interface WCPairingUpdateResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: true;
}
```

### wc_pairingUpgrade

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingUpgradeRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingUpgrade";
  params: {
    permissions: Partial<PairingPermissions>;
  };
}

// response
interface WCPairingUpgradeResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: true;
}
```

  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";

}
```

### wc_pairingPayload

This request is used to relay payloads that match the list of methods agreed upon pairing settlement. Any requests sent with unauthorized methods will be immediately rejected by the client.

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingPayloadRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingPayload";

  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: any;
}
```

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingPingRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingPing";
  params: {};

  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  result: true;
}
```

```typescript
// request
interface WCPairingNotificationRequest {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: "wc_pairingNotification";
  params: {
    type: string;
