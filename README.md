# WalletConnect v1.x.x

## Introduction

WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Wallets and Dapps \(Web3 Apps\). The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Bridge server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request. It also includes an optional Push server to allow Native applications to notify the user of incoming payloads for established connections.

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect protocol has references implementations written in Typescript for the Client \(browser/react-native/nodejs\), the Bridge Server and the Push server.

To quickly setup for your Dapp or Wallet, go to [Quick Start](quick-start/) for code examples.

To read in more detail about the WalletConnect protocol, go to [Technical Specification](tech-spec.md)

Additionally you can also consult the API references for [Client](client-api.md), [Bridge Server](bridge-server.md) and [Push Server](push-server.md)
