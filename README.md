# WalletConnect v2.0.0-alpha

## Introduction

WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Dapps and Wallets. The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Relay server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request.

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect protocol has references implementations written in Typescript for the Client and the Relay Server

To quickly setup for your Dapp or Wallet, go to [Quick Start](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-docs/tree/4665484efb48d649211b3afa7e6a38eac4f3d104/quick-start/README.md) for code examples.

To read in more detail about the WalletConnect protocol, go to [Technical Specification](tech-spec.md)

Additionally you can also consult the API references for [Client](client-api.md) and [Relay Server](relay-server.md).
