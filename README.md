# WalletConnect v1.x

## Description

Wallet Connect is a simple solution that bridges communication between browser-based Dapps and mobile wallets using a QR code to establish the initial connection. It is an open protocol and does not require a Dapp user to install a browser extension. The protocol is agnostic to specific mobile wallets a user may want to use and enables Dapp developers to integrate with multiple wallets through a single implementation.

- enable users to use their mobile wallets with Dapps without having to install a browser extension
- enable users to use the wallet of their choice without worrying about which Dapps have integrated with which wallets
- simplify wallet integration for Dapp developers instead of requiring them to integrate each wallet individually
- provide flexibility to Dapp developers about which Wallet Connect bridge servers they want to use to communicate with mobile wallets
- provide control to the mobile wallet developers on how push notifications are sent to their users

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect standard is implemented in Javascript for both Browser and Wallet side and in Python for the Bridge and Push server.
