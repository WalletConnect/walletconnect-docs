# WalletConnect v1.0.0-beta

## Introduction

WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Wallets and Dapps \(Web3 Apps\). The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Bridge server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request. It also includes an optional Push server to allow Native applications to notify the user of incoming payloads for establishes connections.

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect protocol has references implementations written in Typescript for the Client SDK \(browser/react-native\), the Bridge Server and the Push server.

To quickly setup for your Dapp or Wallet, go to [Quick Start](quick-start.md) for code examples.

To read in more detail about the WalletConnect protocol, go to [Technical Specification](tech-spec.md)
